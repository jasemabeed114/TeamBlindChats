4,"Oct 6, 2020","Oci is shit with their offer processes.I recently rejected a offer from them.I had offers going upto 320K and OCI confirmed that they can match it. I din have a deadline and told them clearly that I will be making a decision only when I see all offers so they said fine let us know when all your offers are in and then we will make a offer to be competitive.2 weeks later they came back with 260K and said this is our max and sorry we could not match the 320K offer. I rejected them next day.They also did not give me an offer unless I confirmed that I have finished all interviews and all offers are in and 320K is the final offer from startup(paper money) and 270K from public company.So it has been my experience as well that HRs at OCI are trying to be over smart making candidates wait, reject other offers and always want to make an offer at the end. Absolutely shitty way to go about it imo.So with all this I had kinda already decided that I will pass on them. In your case, tell them that you were able to get other companies to increase the deadline by a week since you din want to reject any offer unless you see oci numbers as verbal confirmation doesn't mean much until real numbers are present. Do what's best for you.HRs promising numbers and coming back severely low is pretty common and happened to me with my Oracle, Salesforce and Twilio offers. So believe me, it's a very bad tactic and don't trust until you see the offer letter.
