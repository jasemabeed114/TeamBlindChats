2,May 9,I‚Äôm sure because I and my friends have gotten multiple bonuses. You expect in general 50-60% of it. 100% is rare to get unfortunately. And why I called it retirement firm is because everyone in banking knows it and calls it that. JPMC is the place to be if its your last stint. I know a friend who was in JPMCs team working on their own version of Ethereum but finally it fizzles out. Its a risk. Also tech wise banks are very limited and everything needs approval including using a python library not inside the firm. From tech coming to banking might feel like a huge blow. Also VPs in banks dont code at all. Rarely seen anyone doing it. So there is that. Makes it very difficult to move lets say as a Tech EM to Amazon later.

0,"Dec 22, 2019","VP at a bank versus at a tech company are two totally different things that interestingly share the same name. For example, at JP Morgan there are VPs everywhere. Most of them aren't even managers at all. They're just engineers/developers with no one reporting to them or have any leadership in their roles.The way it works is that there are two titles next to you at the bank. One is your role (Developer/Engineer/Finance Manager...etc) and a hierarchy title (Associate, VP, MD...etc).You could start as a junior member with Associate title, and in a year or two get a good end of year review (and be a good friend to your boss and tell him a few good jokes) and next hierarchy level you get is a VP.Once done, you go on LinkedIn and add the title ""I'm the Amazing Vice President of Technology Research At the Big Morgan Stanley"" like all the other thousands are doing now adays lol. And when those in tech companies check your profiles having no clue they get impressed.It makes sense to ask for the TC before the title when joining to get a more accurate representation of what the level is. Or better, don't join as a developer. You'll probably regret it if you're coming from tech companies.",7,djayo,/company/Apple/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/JPMC-VP-Software-Engineer-DvGhwVUo,JPMorgan

Your C1 offer is significantly higher than your other 2 relative to the CoL of the area, but Richmond isn't exactly a center of opportunity.Contrary to the results of this poll, Nordstrom is a failing company with negative growth, subject to the retail apocalypse and with little to no career growth prospects to the extent that having it on your resume may be a demerit. The TC has a significantly lower buying power relative to CoL than C1 and even lower than JPMC if you live in Jersey and commute.

0,"Oct 6, 2019","JPMC is not a tech company. You won't grow as an SDE there.Out of Amazon and Microsoft, I would say go for Amazon. I've interned at both places, Microsoft Hyderabad and Amazon Bangalore and can tell you there's a huge difference in the learning curve. For starting out your career Amazon will give you the right environment to grow and actually learn skills that make you indispensable in the market in the longer term. I joined Amazon after my internship and worked there for 2 years, so can vouch for that. The only downside is your stocks only start getting vested after you've completed 2 years, so if you're planning to switch or go for Masters soon don't expect any cash to come in via that route.Microsoft, in contrast would probably pay a little more in terms of benefits and stocks (their free stuff can't be beaten). However, I wouldn't go for Microsoft at the beginning of my career simply because it doesn't have the same opportunities of growth at that level. If you're satisfied with your life and want to marry and settle down, go work at Microsoft because it'll give you the opportunity to do that. But right now, making yourself indispensable is key and Amazon would do that to youI hope this helped you, all the best. In the end, it won't matter.

1,Apr 27,"I'm sorry I'm from not from one of the old/new IITs.1. I'm not comparing the quality of ivy leagues (in the US) to IITs. The point I'm trying to make is that they are considered to be the best in India the same way ivy leagues are considered to be the best the world.2. Many companies offer different packages at non IIT and IITs like GS and Standard Chartered. As a someone mentioned, some companies maybe offering slightly higher packages at older IITs compared to new ones(just a handful probably). If you see the average package data it'd be very similar though (like you mentioned)3. I too had an option to get a major like Textile/Metallurgy in one of the new IITs or get CSE in a tier 2 college. I went for CSE.For the same majors, older IITs are generally tougher to get into than the new ones (atleast for CSE)Ivy leagues don't have such a system which is great and hope India too adopts that kinda system.I understand that you think I'm comparing IITs to ivy leagues (that'd be absurd). I'm not comparing. Just trying to explain to Facebook that IITs are to India what Ivy leagues are to the world and IIT Delhi/Bombay etc are to India what Harvard/Stanford/MIT are to the world.Peace.",10,patola7,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/[India]-Thread-of-new-grad-SWE-TC-in-India-MMEnxMND,JPMorgan
