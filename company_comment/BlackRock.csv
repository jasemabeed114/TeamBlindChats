3,3d,"If you would pay taxes in Hungary, the net amount you would receive is 465,500 HUF/month.

And most institutional customers are not so nice to implementation people! Moving into Product side is possible but I've seen very very few people make the move.

4,"Jul 20, 2020","@indeed4 why ignoring the majority proven data and science and just picking the outlier? This is not the Amazonian data centric way imho. I am not experts on Covid, I believe a few earlier replies answered that. But still, that is the not point. The point is: with over half years of real life experiments, we know simple protocols such as wearing masks, social distancing and washing hand really goes a long way: save millions of lives, get the economy back to normal.
