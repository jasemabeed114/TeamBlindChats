For example, McKinsey TYPICALLY has a preference for top 20/25 MBA or for your current job to be in another top consulting firm. If you don’t have the right set of credentials today, you will need to network / build brand names before you can get to the right consulting firm.

2,Apr 29,Yes! That is my back up plan. The problem is I am an L2 atm. Promotion timeline is quite slow I have been working here a year and have been told I will prob get promoted in another 6 months ( promotion committee told me I need to sustain the performance I am at to prove I am a L3 ). That means to get to a L4 it prob will be another 2-3 years and then will have to try switch into PM.
