0,"Dec 23, 2020","There are certainly a lot of ‚Äútakes‚Äù ppl will have, some more negative than others, but based on my experience thus far here‚Äôs my opinion (also disclaimer, I‚Äôm at PM):1) Its an R&D investment. Uber isn‚Äôt just owning Postmates‚Äô brand. Its getting their talent. Some will get laid off, of course, but Uber will magically have 100+ new Eats engineers who have experience specifically building delivery software. Uber believes in the future of delivery and needs more resources ASAP to beat DD.2) Contrary to what you implied, Postmates (similarly to Caviar) DOES have some brand loyalty. Postmates is behind its competition because it‚Äôs smaller, less feature-heavy, has fewer restaurants, etc. And yet 10% of ppl STILL USE IT over DD and Eats, which are objectively better. PM has great design & branding that certain demographics love.3) The plan of transitioning customers from PM to UE will be careful and strategic. The idea is to make it as frictionless as possible, and any PM user whose been loyal (esp. premium members) will be able to start ordering from the Eats app seamlessly. So that should hedge customer attrition.These thoughts are based off the merger work I‚Äôve seen / heard about happening thus far. I think my first point in that list is really the primary thing.

For better service‚ÄùDid you even read my post above?I mentioned that there are many countries such as Singapore and Japan where tipping is looked down and yet the service is top notch compared to the US. Even in some poorer countries like Indonesia, you get better service without tipping.Do you have study that show that tipping WILL equal better service?Go to Chick-fil-a or In-n-Out or talk to the employees (and ex-employees). They don‚Äôt get tips but they provide top notch service and generally are happier. Their work is more demanding too compared to the server. Try standing in front of the grill, running around making food and shakes for 7 hours (1 hour is for lunch, break, etc). Server don‚Äôt make the food, so they don‚Äôt stand in front of the grill.So my recommendation is the same: increase the server wage from $2 to $15 hour plus benefit and abolish tipping.Tipping actually reduce wage, since companies like DoorDash can pay their gig-worker next to nothing and have the consumer pay the difference.The federal laws that allow min wage of $2.13 for worker that receive tips  need to be abolished, just like back when min wage was $4.25. Today, many states have min wage that is equal to $10 or more. Some cities like SF have $15 min wage and even mandate healthcare.But like you said, you‚Äôll keep tipping and no one is going to stop you. That‚Äôs not the intent here.

That's going to change, the most complicated queries really just aren't that hard and people will leetcode that shit.2) Machine learning will be automated. It'll be a long time until its fully automatic, but model selection and tuning is already being done algorithmically (see SageMaker). ML is going to be a lot more accessible, even without a PhD.3) There's going to be a flood of new grads.

4,"Dec 17, 2020","DoorDash won because they stole driver tips to be cheaper than the competition as well as focusing on subrubs than cities, which had more families than single people so the basket size and hence their 30% commission is bigger per order in $ terms. No one gives a shit if the food is from doordash or ubereats or GrubHub or Postmates. It's the same fucking food. Uber under TK would've fired right back but they got lucky that Uber was under heavy PR scrutiny during that time so Uber did the right thing instead. But like a lot of things doing the right thing doesn't win. Look at Facebook they didn't get to where they are being being moral to the world. By stealing driver tips though they built market share by being the cheapest and then leveraged this into Chase deal to lock in the millennials, then got lucky that covid came and people ordered more food and timed right when the vaccine is coming to go ipo to dump their stock on retail.Not saying they didn't work hard to get here and their timing was great for a lot of their moves (their choice of when to go ipo), some great tacitical moves (Chase deal with dashpass and suburb focus) but there are a few questionable moves like the tip stealing, and a lot of luck (covid, Uber going thru it's pr issues in 2017).",8,uOG,/company/Uber/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Doordash-Tale-of-David-to-Goliath-ZYDMc6rz,Postmates
