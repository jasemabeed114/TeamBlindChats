0,Apr 28,"Based on your YOE that seems alright.. but you may have a little room for negotiation especially given your location and current base. The stock is indeed a valuable addition to TC I would not write it off in your decision-making.Regarding your questions about working at Doximity, it's pretty good and I would generally recommend. Great remote-first company that shows its appreciation of employees through all kinds of little ways. Strong leadership imo. And when covid finishes winding down the quarterly offsites are a great time / opportunity to travel. But it is what you make of it, you have a large responsibility in the quality of your experience in a remote setting.",2,hooba,/company/Doximity/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Doximity-low-compensation-Xc8GmGjq,Doximity

4,Apr 28,I donâ€™t work there anymore but can say the culture is great. Compensation is below average. Stock for private company is just paper money so no comment.The best thing about this company was the quarterly Offsites where the company invites all hq and remote folks to fun places like Lake Tahoe or Pebble beach and have fun.
