When I did an interview with them, I was kinda unsure if my time complexity was correct as well, but my interviewer gave me the ok and I ended up passing so I wouldn’t dwell on that part.I’m not quite sure if companies actually look that the recording. IMO it’d be tedious to look at an hour interview for every candidate you have in the pipeline. Also, it’d kinda defeat the point of hiring another company to do the interview if companies spend money hiring Karat to conduct the interview and then spend a bunch of time auditing it. At that point, it might be cheaper just to do the interviews in house. I think it might just serve as a proof of services rendered for the company hiring Karat to conduct the interview, or as a reference point if the review feedback is iffy.",2,Gyij81,/company/GoDaddy/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Karat-interview----indeed-cdSMdQgK,Indeed

Instead, ingratiate yourself to someone high up in the eng org, and have them advocate for you. Director level, and even important SWE3 managers can bypass HR's red tape when it comes to transfers. Switching to SWE by doing a good job and telling HR that you want to switch departments will likely be an uphill battle.Hyams has joked about our semi-technical departments as pools from which to poach motivated folks for PM and SWE roles.

Catered lunch every day. Tons of snacks and drinks in the office. A good mix of laid back, while still having good growth opportunities and challenges. Open PTO. Most people work from home as needed (typically about a day a week). Casual dress code. I've found the pay to be quite competitive. I mean, it's not quite FAANG, but a definitely solid, especially when you consider WLB. Office is modern, in the Russell Investment Center, with a great view of Puget Sound. We're moving into the top 10 floors of the new build on 2nd and University next year. Overall I say go for it! We have our salary bands posted, so you should be able to see the range you'd fit into.
