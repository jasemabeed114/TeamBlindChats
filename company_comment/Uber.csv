Internal tools are IMO pretty comprehensive and powerful, even tho I feel like some tools are just highly overlapping in terms of functionality but things are getting unified into one platform. Definitely dont wanna go back to use Powerdrill for metrics lol. In general observability tools in U are more open source embraced and pretty standard across industry. Jira for project management I‚Äôd say quite similar exp to Bugnizer. In terms of daily work Slack and Zoom is heavily used in Uber which I feel like faster turn around time for questions, discussions compared to gmail threads.

Although the gig companies aren't forced to do it, it's the only way to sustain a profit. This would reduce reliability and increase wait times for users during peak demands while increasing prices and eliminating 80% of the roles.Retain flexibility, ensure minimum payments, pay into health care/sick leave/pto/unemployment insurance plans or fund based on pro rated time on each platform.

I bet Uber pays a lot, and you‚Äôll probably work less because it‚Äôs kinda a mature company nowJoin Samsara if:- You want to work for a B2B SaaS company- You thrive in a the (chaotic) environment of a startup where the bias is towards getting things done and shipping things quicker- Are okay taking the risk in Samsara‚Äôs stock, but you do have the potential for a high reward- You want to work for a smaller engineering org, but have potential to make bigger impacts- You are okay taking slightly lesser TC, with your stocks being illiquid/paper until IPO (whenever that might be). Again, potential higher reward thoI‚Äôm personally biased for Samsara because:- I work here- I really enjoy the people I work with. And while I work harder than people at other companies, I enjoy it and my overall work-life balance is pretty good- The company has increased pay significantly recently, and they have been very employee-friendly- I get to do more things, and have a bigger impact at an earlier stage of the company- I‚Äôm a long-term bull for the company and the hidden industries it is in (fleet, logistics, industrial, cameras), and while I don‚Äôt have a lot of stock, I think it‚Äôll be pretty good long-term.- If you get same TC from both, I personally would take SamsaraThings that apply to both:- Self driving is a risk (and kinda an opportunity) for both- Both will give you exposure to some great engineering- Both will look good on your resume IMOLmk if you have any questions!",22,supernerd7,/company/Samsara/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Uber-or-samsara-GYf1OZXV,Uber

And there has been a LOT of engineers quitting: layoffs fired bottom 20%, and then the top 20% left. Leadership had the plan to move teams over to India, over time. But they did not expect so many of US engineers to quit, hence the rush in hiring back. Leadership also assumed with COVID few people would leave. But good engineers at Uber got a pay boost at the likes of FANG, Snowflake, Zoom etc.Just keep in mind that the work will be keeping the lights on, and the plan is still to move as much of engineering to India as possible, the next few years. But the pay is good, and you can (now) negotiate higher.My two cents is it‚Äôs worth a go, Uber stock has a lot higher potential to 2x in a year than those stocks that already rallied.
