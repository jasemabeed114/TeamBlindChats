2,"Apr 10, 2019","Coming from someone who worked in banking before, I think it's extremely unlikely that Morgan Stanley would risk its reputation, which it has built over DECADES, to do anything illegal in this case - many people are interested in shorting many stocks, it's a large market out there, what is the ROI of focusing exclusively on Lyft when it could potentially be illegal? Also, Morgan Stanley is a market-maker, it is the counter party to literally trillions of dollars of transactions, many of which may seem to have various intents when taken out of context, but mostly it is merely catering to market interest, and it is generally foolish to read into market-making transactions without enough context. (Not to say that financial institutions never do anything sketchy, but I'm just saying it's very hard to separate signal from noise here, while it's very easy for people who are biased to see what they want to see).I've read a few articles on this, the original one from New York Post (https://nypost.com/2019/04/05/lyft-threatens-morgan-stanley-with-legal-action-over-ipo-claims/) includes an actual pre-IPO investor claiming that they did in fact do this through Morgan. They even outlined a scheme where they bothered to create a special acquisition vehicle through which individual investors can short shares. I'm surprised that what is not being called out in this story is that there was so much interest from Lyft's pre-IPO investors to bet against the stock.

JPM back then was an investment bank, before it had merged with any retail banking.  Now it is essentially seen as Chase Bank, just a bigass retail bank. Nothing special on your resume. But MS has some cache because it is a bulge bracket investment bank. JPM is too, but it’s also a huge retail bank. I’d stick with the true investment bank. It will likely open more doors. I know 3 senior level developers contracting with them after years of experience elsewhere, so it can’t be that bad.

7,"May 24, 2018","If you like the role/product , it can be very impactful. Make sure it’s in the business cost center - you’ll have a lot more control over the overall impact.Re the title - VP as an external hire is not bad, though you could have been one level higher if internal for 12 years - if you were doing very well.What I’ve gathered based on levels and TC numbers - tech and bank tech titles can roughly be compared as below. These are AMZN levels - the curious ones can join this with levels.fyi for other FNGs, to see where it translates.L5 - Associate/non-VPL6 - VPL7 - EDL8 - MDAs always - there will always be overlap between bands etc, but this is how the numbers align the titles.Also - the culture and work is massively  different. If you’re a purist, you’ll suffer at banks. If you’re entrepreneurial and figure out ways to get shit done, and don’t mind hacking around - you’ll thrive.

9,"Aug 20, 2019","Yeah, I think the base is so low because it’s my first (relevant) job and I was a little gun-shy in negotiating for more. But I figure my resume is most important to me right now until I graduate. (Though I do plan on asking for more shortly.) I do have a couple friends working for Morgan Stanley so I think I’ll follow that guidance and try to see what they can do for me.

5,"May 31, 2018","Dude...I can’t comment on salesforce position but I was a prod mgr at Morgan in NYC a few years back. I’d caution you here, since MS is run by contractors and near impossible to get things done without consensus. Spend millions to figure out how to deploy features/transform and do nothing with it. Otherwise they have pretty good food at the 1 plaza location, also great prestige but products are not exciting. Schwab on the other hand is very aggressively hiring prod mgrs right now (in Austin specifically) and spending lots of money on all their digital properties (mobile + desktop trading tools). Personally, if you’re looking for something more engaging/rewarding I would do Schwab.Ps. My close friend works at salesforce and he loves it, but complains about pay ( not in a PM role).
