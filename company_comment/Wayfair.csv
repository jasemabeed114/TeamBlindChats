2,Feb 27,Wayfair tends to hire a lot out of the elite colleges in Boston . It does not matter about their degree or experience .

Not necessarily dumb but they may be legacy admits . The result is you will get interviewed by preppy elitists who have a bloated sense of ego who consider engineers as tradesmen .

5,"May 14, 2020","Of course you try your best to push for improvement before going down the PIP road. Some people just don't take verbal and written feedback seriously enough. A formal pip is really just about putting all the cards on the table, when nothing else is working. I had someone on my team who just wasn't focusing enough to contribute a meaningful amount of work to our sprint. I brought it up continuously in 1 on 1s, and in career development meetings. It wasn't until I filed a PIP with HR that he took it seriously and actually worked on consistent delivery. I was upfront with him about it, my approach wasn't ""your being fired soon"". It was closer to, look I know you can do this, and I need to see you do it consistently in this time frame.Sure, it can be stressful to be on a PIP. I'm not sure I agree with the shattered trust sentiment though. I think it all depends on how it's communicated. If you're honest and do everything reasonable in your power to help them succeed, I think it's totally possible to retain trust throughout and after a PIP.",3,catalogboi,/company/Wayfair/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/PIP-At-Wayfair-wrVtFZdF,Wayfair

Managers often take credit of their subordinate's work and L1s (people with MS degress) hardly get to speak their minds in meetings. Most of the times it's expected that they go with the flow and say yes wherever ""required"".But as a result, L4s and L5s thrive. You'll find most of the PhDs - people who have studied and grinded their ass for 8-10 years in academia and who actually know some shit - will be sitting at L2s and L3s and will be hardly promoted.So you are gonna have a time of your life at Wayfair.",9,bigdipper,/company/Wayfair/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Amazon-vs-Wayfair-offer-sm6qc2Bj,Wayfair

2,Apr 21,"Just personal opinion looking, have left Wayfair after a number of years there. The culture has gone downhill with beancounters and Amazon-style mentality on PIPs, but lower comp, and politicians run the place instead of real engineers with respectable experience. As more things open up, less online shopping, and they failed to turn a profit again last quarter. Comp is heavily based on stock, which I believe has already peaked, so really you‚Äôre betting that people will now buy more than at peak COVID for the next 4 years of your cliff? Highly risky. Plus the engineering brand in the community is pretty bad, not only from practices and how behind central platform teams are (you‚Äôre not allowed to use any GCP services directly, but wait 6-12 months for some abstracted wrapper device to be reinvented internally - seriously?), but also how they grow their teams, where they routinely ramp up hiring massively because attrition is so bad and then wind up firing half those people because they mishired and need to start over every 18 months. Last big layoff of 600 people was Q1 2020, so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll announce another big hiring push where they‚Äôll fire 50% 12 months later.

5,"Jun 29, 2019","It's part of the STO initiative where business leaders want clear distinction between what's mine and what's yours. Agree completely that engineering should be one large group but at some point, teams that are super large don't scale and it's hard to manage too. Might as well plan for the growth and split the team accordingly.",0,WNEm45,/company/Wayfair/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Wayfair-team-matching-FGq3qyMJ,Wayfair

Design a DVD / movie sharing website. Again.. dug deep on DB design choices. Good interview, whatever decision i made.. they would add a new requirement that would not work very well with that design choice.
