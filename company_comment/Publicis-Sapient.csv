5,May 11,I have read multiple posts in blind where ppl are cursing themselves after joining Amazon because if their poor work life balance PIP process. In Sapient you won't suffocate that much.. well it also depends what kind of project you are into. But if you are looking for a comparatively better work life balance and comparatively less increments then go with Sapient. But if you are more into in  getting a brand name and better hikes then go with Amazon.,2,MeHuman,/company/Publicis-Sapient/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Amazon-or-Publicis-Sapient-MBYO0h5H,Publicis-Sapient

2,"Nov 15, 2020","Sometimes travel is cool if you only go to large cities. Id get dinner with old friends whenever I was in town. It‚Äôs a con when you travel every week, wake up at 5am on mondays and get back around 11pm on thursdays. Also a con if you‚Äôre traveling to somewhere not as interesting. I missed some fun group events because I was away. Also, firms make travel more bearable by giving larger expense budgets, letting us book economy plus, giving everyone precheck, etc. but I know publicis is known to be cheap so I highly doubt the same will be true for you.Consulting will have lower coding standards because it just needs to work. In many projects, it doesn‚Äôt have to work for very long or you‚Äôre time crunched so your boss tells you to just ignore all tech debt.
