It's hard to predict unless you already know which teams you're considering.Having said that, if you want to grow into a full stack SWE, I don't think perf team is the right choice for you. Perf team does have full stack projects but without passionate in perf engineering, the career growth is generally limited. I've seen many such cases who decided to leave in a short period of time because of this.There are usually many other teams that need full stack SWEs so review the projects carefully and talk to hiring managers or other senior members in the team before making a decision.",0,jdhcmxd,/company/VMware/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Intel-VS-VMware-8Cw8duYL,Intel

Intel will mostly want to promote you if best worker in your current group + budget looks good for that yearly focal review or they are worried about losing you. You could transfer internally in a year to a better job, but without promotion or pay increase. Folsom is literally in the middle of no where, even Arizona is a better place to live.For micron, you will have opportunity to change company later, but the rent will be 2.5-3k/month if you want to live alone.

But it may be easier to get promoted or change company.My advice is, the memory business is career suicide. Either move to the Folsom burbs and wait to die, or move to the bay, work hard and get into firmware or software or something else.Both companies will not have a large amount of success or growth anytime soon, and you will be a sitting duck.

1,"Jun 8, 2019","@no-sql thanks. Yes I am software engineer. I think it's easier to get a job for a company in bay area. For example,  FANG in Seattle has less head count and less groups to join, so it's harder to get a job there, not as many opportunities. Your chances of being hired at FANG in bay area would be much higher.  The ratio of #people applying / #jobs is much worse in Seattle than in bay area for any FANG company. You have current fb employees internally transferring from bay area to Seattle, then you have people from Amazon and Microsoft applying to fb in Seattle... Makes it Much harder to get into fb Seattle.Transitioning to bay area isn't difficult. Just move here, pay 2.5k for a nice studio or 2k for a really old and crappy place, or move in with a bunch of roommates for 1.5k each.For fang just depends on which company you join. They all require different things. Google is only leet code for lower levels, but it's very unpredictable in questions and hard to prepare, others are much more predictable. Amazon would be easy in leet code and then system design. Airbnb requires excellent behavioural and culture fit and is more predictable in technical. Every company requires different things, I can't give you advise unless company specific. For study, I recommend 2-3 months of heavy constant study. What I did was focus on only one company and succeed at my first try, but you can do it however you like.

Every OEM and hyperscaler is waiting for Micron to release those SSDs. In the next few years, 3DXP as DIMM replacement shall be the big thing and again Micron will be sought after.Micron as a company is bound to do better due to their DRAM market and the emergig SSD business. There is much more potential for the Micron stock to go up than Intel.200k$ TC in the Bay area is not bad at all. There are several folks here with 60 to 70% of that TC and life still goes on.Moving to the bay opens up opportunities and makes it better for Job security. Once you are here and you don‚Äôt like the Micron job, you can apply to WD(HGST/Sandisk)/Toshiba/Samsung/SkHynix or any other SSD player in the ecosystem. If not those, then FB/Apple are hiring several Storage product development engineers associated with SSD/system architecture etc.Also it is always better to experience more companies when you are young to get a diverse perspective on company strategies/culture etc than stayin with the same company for so long that they brand you a dinosaur!",3,xyzabd,/company/Hitachi-Vantara/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Intel-NSG-vs-Micron-roa2ReUW,Intel

2,"Feb 15, 2020","Hey lif when I got my offer from Intel 2 years ago as an RCG that was the same TC package I got (for CAD Engineer). I tried to negotiate my base pay but HR didn‚Äôt budge much. They did give me a 12k signing bonus.WLB depends on your group but it‚Äôs pretty balanced if you ask me. My WLB is crap but that‚Äôs cause I choose to work extra after regular hours. As long as you get your work done that‚Äôs all they care about. As a software engineer I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs much opportunity for job growth here for me, at least in the dept I‚Äôm in (TMG). Many of my colleagues have recently left to other companies and they‚Äôre getting paid significantly more. The year to year pay growth is very minimal.Overall I think it‚Äôs a decent place to start at for a first job and looks good on the resume and this is a fairly decent TC package for an RCG in Oregon. But in terms of long term job growth this isn‚Äôt the place for me. It might be for you though.I would recommend you try to negotiate. Now that I‚Äôm part of the interviewing team for my group I realize what a pain it is to find people that you want to hire, so once you‚Äôve gotten that far you have some leverage to negotiate with.

0,"Oct 27, 2020",Here is how to calculate your APBYour target % of your salary i.e 3% x 3 = 9% of your base. So 9K for every 100K base.This number then gets multiplied by another number between 0 and 1 which is dependent on company performance. It should be close to 1 the way they define performance but for e.g this year it is 0.95 ( if the doesn‚Äôt drop further in the next 2 months)So your total APB would be $8.5K per 100K baseYour cash bonus also includes a QPB that is paid quarterly. It is quoted in terms of ‚Äúearning days‚Äù. It‚Äôs usually 4-6 days per quarter so about 20 days of eligible earning per a year.As noted with poor performance the QPB will go down for the next few quarters at least so it‚Äôs not going to be what the recruiter is promising based on past data.,4,RobCrook,/company/Intel/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Intel-APB-Multiplier-ZM8k5M28,Intel

There were many posts in the Intel internal forum about this, how frontline managers reported to upper management that below market pay was causing talent to flee in droves. Upper management either was oblivious or didn't give a shit because their whole plan is to outsource as much as they can to Bangalore.Even the AI group head Naveen talked about how it was a daily struggle to attract and retain talented AI SWEs (more than 50% of his original Nervana engineering team left already).

I took a moment to research his background, that guy Saf has lead strategy for technology globally at McKinsey and there are level 7 and level 8 software engineers at Intel calling him a diversity hire. All I‚Äôm saying is, focus on your damn job. I‚Äôve seen employees who are black, white, Indian, Asian, and more who were ENTIRELY incompetent when they came to Intel. Could barely communicate, let alone do a basic job. And I‚Äôve seen black and Hispanic employees go above and beyond while their incompetent white counterparts get all the mentorship, special projects, etc. There are people who have seen the opposite.

It's pretty hard to get IR unless your manager doesn't like you. But getting SSL4 is possible. The hilarious this was that in the last large layoff (in 2016 called ACT - Accelerating Change and Transformation LOL) of 12-15k people, the criteria was either IR or SSL4 in the past couple of years, managers had no clue that giving a report an SSL4 meant cya. NO IDEA. So some people who unfortunately got SSL4 had to be walked out, with the manager and report both dumbfounded at what happened.There was an ex-poster/high level manager here by the name of nononsense who had to walk his report out, then successfully appealed that decision and rehired the report because he had no idea SSL4 meant ""out on your ass."" HR decided to conduct training AFTER ACT to realign focal expectations and consequences. I remember the MCM (CEO and inner circle high level execs) said in a townhall something to the effect of ""tough luck, you should have known that SSL4 meant f u, cya"" to a manager who complained about this.

2,"Aug 5, 2019","I think Apple got a pretty good deal. Bob swan could have had Apple by the üèÄ by not selling the division and making them suck up to Qualcomm and Intel. But that was not meant to be. Someone underestimated the total addressable market over the next 5 years. It‚Äôs not just Apple who would be interested in 5G modems. There will be several others. Guess who will be making s load of money? Not Apple, not Intel. It‚Äôs Q&S.",2,statarb,/company/Samsung/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/intel-inside-BOpn7qom,Intel
3,"Aug 4, 2019","Intel exited the modem business mainly on concerns of profitability. They may have been a year or so late to 5G, but they would nevertheless have got there. Keep in mind that Intel delivered a 4G modem that Apple thought was good enough to put in their iPhone.Apple doesn't care if the modems it makes (with intels engineers) don't make a big profit. Even if they merely break even,  it will allow Apple to continue its trend towards full vertical integration. As a by-product, they will also hurt Qualcomm financially. Qualcomm is a key impediment to Apple's plans because Apple's Asian rivals rely very greatly on Qualcomm's technology to compete with Apple. A reduction in revenues to Qualcomm will mean less ability for Qualcomm to continue investing in building technologies for Apple's rivals.",5,QyVu61,/company/Qualcomm/,Eng,/post/intel-inside-BOpn7qom,Intel

6,"Aug 5, 2019","Without a high volume smartphone customer, a 5G solution does not work out financially.  Intel needed maybe another year to productize the chip and get the KPIs to acceptable levels but got beaten by Qualcomm who could deliver on time for Apple2200 will be trimmed . 5G is incredibly complex with digital, analog, RF, DSP & control firmware, certification, field trials etc. 2200 includes many other functions than core modem and a sizeable team is needed to execute this beast. Apple has a laser focus on product and that will be quite beneficial to set feature priorities and realistic  deadlines on the 5G solution.",4,Kitten420,/company/Intel/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/intel-inside-BOpn7qom,Intel
7,"Aug 6, 2019","1B is dirt cheap given they got Patent, IPs and people.You can google how much Qualcomm paid to purchase Atheros  many years ago.Now the interesting question is that whether Apple could manage the same team to deliver.
