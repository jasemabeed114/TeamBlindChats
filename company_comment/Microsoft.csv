10,Mar 24,"At Microsoft it would be more about looking at documentation, code and understanding how things work and coding features only. You will understand how things are implemented at Microsoft. At the startup you will be coming up with new ideas and doing PoCs to validate them. You'll be learning from the engineers working there. But mostly it will be trial and error and learning things yourself. You will try maybe 10 approaches and then figure out the one that works. In process of working on 9 that don't work you'll learn a lot about what doesn't work and why. Work will be tight. But you will learn a lot more than what you would at Microsoft.

0,May 11,People keep saying your TC will get doubled in Amazon after promo but dude you loose so much money and get 0 stocks till that promo happens due to the shitty vesting schedule. It just adds up. People change companies in 1-2 years anyway. If you're sure you're a great performer and can get to SDE 2 in 1 year then great. Use that TC to switch to other companies with better TC. But in general Microsoft wlb and culture is way better than Amazon. You can get good TC after switching with competing offersEdit - keep in mind you get no extra stocks at Amazon after promotion. The third year vesting is 40% which makes the TC better.

Some companies avoid LC style interviews but as a new grad there's not much else they can ask. A CS grad might have an advantage but a couple of targeted courses and some practice should fix that.

1,Apr 13,"As a PhD student, the candidate is very likely to receive some kind of financial aid and a stipend, usually in the form of an RA or TA. So he might as well directly start the program instead of taking on loans for the MS program if he's that's sure he'll be doing the PhD.An MS in CS probably has a higher chance of landing an interview than a Physics grad but getting the job probably has the same odds if the candidate prepares.It depends on the candidate, his aptitude and his end goals. Life is more about just degrees and money. As an older PhD candidate (lates 20s by the time he does his MS and gets a couple of years of work experience), he'll miss out on life experiences that the US offers. I lived with a 30 year old PhD roommate for a brief while - great guy who was miserable about his decision to start the program.
