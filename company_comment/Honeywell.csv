1,"Nov 8, 2019",Hey thanks for the input. I approach few people on LinkedIn that had same roles previously. The work wasn‚Äôt exciting. It was biztech management with no coding/development. So i declined it last week as the deadline was Monday only.Got another offer this morning for software dev. I like the position and stack is modern too. Money is still shit. But I guess thats what they pay for internships unless its FAANG,0,Bearded007,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Fullstack-to-the-role-that-is-kind-of-PMintern-SmTkiaMi,Honeywell
2,"Nov 9, 2019",Congratulation! I think the problem is more with the canadian job market. I was there too. I miss canada but cant afford to live in Canada with the pay grade there,0,blind1032,/company/NVIDIA/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Fullstack-to-the-role-that-is-kind-of-PMintern-SmTkiaMi,Honeywell
3,"Nov 7, 2019",Take it if you want to continue to be a pm. Take any role and it is hard to escape related roles afterwards,0,blind1032,/company/NVIDIA/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Fullstack-to-the-role-that-is-kind-of-PMintern-SmTkiaMi,Honeywell
