0,Apr 14,"Hey finally someone said Protiviti.I‚Äôll keep it short. 3YOE in Security & Privacy (solution within Technology Consulting) has been incredible quite honestly.Pros:-Talented management within solutions you can count on for knowledge sharing-Projects are plentiful, if there is a specific tool/area you want to focus on, chances are you can get onto the project-Culture is a big one, less of the narcissistic personalities that you see in big4/mbb and more work life balance, get work done and keep the client happy type of styleCons:-Most of the time you don‚Äôt have a say on which projects you will get staffed on, and who knows what the client/project expectations are. (Who wants to go to Minnesota in the winter? Not I)-Pay is slightly lower than big4-Management Consulting is not really a good term for a majority of the projects, which tend to be client environment assessments or risk assessments, your milage may vary.",2,1dub,/company/Protiviti/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Protiviti---what-is-it-like-working-there-0gBYZHAT,Protiviti
1,Apr 14,"From my experience, I‚Äôve observed that most TC and S&P projects are related to assessments.If you‚Äôre tech heavy then this might not be the right place. There are some very tech heavy projects but not too many. Pay is not at par with industry standards. Company culture is alright, but very dependent on what your project team is. Some teams aren‚Äôt very friendly and not very collaborative. It‚Äôs a mixed bag. Definitely look at what you want career wise and ask the HR a lot of questions regarding the same.",0,SF2345,/company/Protiviti/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Protiviti---what-is-it-like-working-there-0gBYZHAT,Protiviti

3,"Jul 20, 2020",I have 10 YOE. consulting is better than bank for risk compliance because you go from back office to front office. I made the move myself and do not regret it. being a moneymaker is great. your bonuses make sense. if you're good you get paid. compliance had too many nebulous goals and politicking between you and your paycheck. protiviti has a better rep than promontory. mckinsey is a much better company overall but unsure what they actually do in risk and compliance and would be surprised if you got hired there. but maybe you can!,1,sickswan,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Considering-move-to-Consulting-jUpojqy8,Protiviti

6,"Jul 20, 2020","I have been acquainted with people at Promontory. As long as you get hired in at an Associate Partner or above, which you may or may not qualify for as it‚Äôs not based on YoE alone, you‚Äôll do very little and get good pay. You will be very much on your own. Nobody internal to IBM works with Promontory on anything, they are a separate operating unit and you have a separate email/separate tools than the rest of IBM.",1,oddblockV2,/company/IBM/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Considering-move-to-Consulting-jUpojqy8,Protiviti

9,"Jul 20, 2020","I‚Äôm not familiar with Promontory itself, but I worked for IBM consulting in the past after leaving Accenture. I was lured there by a higher salary.My view is that if you love bureaucracy and hundreds of layers of management then IBM is for you. Promontory, as consulting, is just another business amongst the thousands that IBM owns and it gets lost in the shuffle of the whole company, so decisions are usually very slow. Also IBM has a habit of consuming the value of every business they buy, then throws it away or leaves it as a zombie business. I lasted 1.5 year at IBM before leaving to join Deloitte.",2,DrAF34,/company/Deloitte/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Considering-move-to-Consulting-jUpojqy8,Protiviti
