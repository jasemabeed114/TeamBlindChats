6,7d,"Wish is a high risk, high reward play. It's stock performance moves alongside other risky tech sector growth stocks like DASH, ABNB, SHOP, etc.In the e-commerce space,  Wish already makes an outsized footprint (100M MAU, 2.5B in sales) in relation to its market-cap (7B) and company size (1200 employees).  Of course problems exist, both due to market forces -- rising cost of shipping from China to US being the main one -- and as a result of internal disfunction that is especially noticeable from the inside.But these problems also represent opportunity to own the stock on the cheap and potentially see massive returns as the company fixes its issues, or the tech growth sector recovers its upward climb.",5,wishubixin,/company/Wish/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Whats-happening-with-WISH-bY61JXvj,Wish

Your growth would by and large be driven by your impact on your team. Someone from Wish can probably chime in, but from my experience most managers don't mind talking about expectations at a certain IC level and what they look for when making a promotion decision. Maybe schedule a chat with your Wish manager and ask him/her about it?To answer your second question, both are solid companies and I don't see either going away anytime soon. I wouldn't focus on the upside too much either, focus on the IP, where you can add value. In 5 years, which company do you think will be in a totally different place than it is today?Assuming Roblox is San Mateo and Wish is Seattle, think about location too. You're young, and you only live once!

9,"Sep 27, 2020","I was a senior engineer at Wish a few years ago and wrote a ton of base code that makes the app work today. I am at FB now and have friends who are currently at Wish or who recently left Wish.**TL;DR**1. Zero company culture, team-by-team basis, run by new grads and interns.2. At Wish you will get to work on a lot of features3. SUPER HACKY CODE4. Lots of competition in the space, eCommerce value inflated by COVID5. Go to wish if you want to be promoted fast and be a lifer. Great learning opportunity but be skillcapped earlier. Make sure your team has solid cultural principles other than having chill people.What StqU02 said pretty much hits the nail on the head. The team's willingness and drive to improve depends on the team, as there is no overall eng culture. My team was able to figure things out and work really well, but once again my manager was someone with 2 YoE and 1 company and there really was no one to learn from. Everyone in my department had ONLY worked at Wish. The VPs and ""directors"" were all interns hired for cheap labor years ago and worked their way up because they made a huge impact. During my time there were more interns than FTEs. The majority of the codebase is written by interns - many of whom are no longer there - so you have to figure out how all their shitty code works. I had interviewed close to 100 people, and almost all of them were new grads ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI myself had a lot of opportunities to affect changes and some of the people I hired from back then are now managers. I definitely learned a ton initially, but my eng skills and learning definitely plateaued early on. Working at Wish became a case of the blind (me) leading the blind (all the other new grads / junior engineers). You will learn a lot from having to figure out a lot of things yourself (lack of infrastructure), but will end up being skill capped pretty early as a manager at Wish, which is why I left since I did not intend to be a Wish lifer.The majority of eng teams at wish are mired in terrible eng culture, lead by junior engineers who think they're the shit because they are now ""managers."" Having a more diverse work background, you will definitely suffer through arguing things with more tenured but less experienced engineers at Wish because they only know how to do things one way.In terms of product, there are many copycats for Wish. All eCommerce is hot right now due to COVID, so Wish's value is inflated. Wish is also currently a one-trick pony, whereas Whatsapp is the #1 messaging app in the world and they are still trying a lot of new things, including a huge play into eCommerce themselves. Wish is FB's #1 customer for ads. However, Wish is a very experiment-heavy product, and you will likely have the freedom to work on many different growth features.Additionally in terms of compensation, Wish is about to IPO so you're not going to get a great value compared to other tech companiesGo to Wish if you want to be a Wish lifer, work fast on tons of features and if you get an amazing offer.

The spike and current decline in cases was the natural curve of the virus and most of our mitigation efforts were too late to be effective (maybe the very early acting states has an effect on spread).Double conspiracy is that the virus spreads most easily between people together in confined spaces and that the stay-at-home orders are actually slowing the rate decrease in cases.",1,tacokahn,/company/Uber/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Lets-wish-Georgia-the-best-OMG3bU5G,Wish

It's too much leverage.If I had a rich family or a sugar daddy spoiling me through the process (tough as a male), then sure.With software engineering, I was net positive within a year of graduating and can now pivot my life to a lower paying field at ANY time.I think the worst IRL nightmare would be getting through 2+ years of medical school and then realizing it isn't for you. Good luck paying that back doing something else lol. Something else could happen while you are studying too. Car accident puts you out of commission (potentially out of the field if there is brain damage)? You could be in a coma with 300k in debt ticking up.I structure my life around avoiding critical failures like this. I'm ok with risk. Risk is fun, but not at this level.Not to mention, doctors have very few paths to working on the beach/from home. They can hang it up and retire to the beach if they make it though.If I were to talk to a group of smart, middle or lower class high school kids that had every option available to them, I'd point them to tech.

0,May 2,"Not a hack but think long and hard about  distance and travel time.  Our first vacation home was in the San Juan islands so was too far away to get the use out of it to justify the expense.  Luckily it turned out to be an awesome investment, but we used it so much less than our current place.  4hrs with a ferry or boat required to get to it vs 2hr drive.Depending on where it is spending money upfront on low maintenance stuff is well worth it.   For our new one we found land and built.  This let us put a lot more into the architectural decisions that cost more but in the northwest environment will last way longer and reduce worry of issues.  Coastal homes take a beating in the winter, mountain homes get huge snow loads, etc.Depending on your purpose make s bedroom into a bunk room if you have kids or want to Airbnb it.  Our kids are older now and always have friends joining for weekends.  Grandparents and siblings families also fit better if you can pile 4-8 kids in one room.  We don‚Äôt rent it but if we did ability to fit multiple families or generations comfortably will let you rent more often for more money.Unless you are spending tons of time there things like closets are far less important than things like storage.  We have to store kayaks, sup, boating stuff, etc. But don‚Äôt need room in bedrooms for clothing/shoes the same way.

3,"Oct 2, 2018","I don't think your premise/example is a good one. Managers do certainly notice and care if every time they walk by you're not around or staring at your phone or watching stupid YouTube videos, etc... If you're a rock star you can get away with it, but ""getting away with it"" isn't the same as consistently making a great impression. It also makes me as a manager look bad if everyone knows that the people on my team are fucking off. Other managers have come to me to say ""hey, every time I walk by x I can see he's not working"" and I'm expected to go follow up on tasks. You don't want your manager to look bad and you don't want him constantly pestering you for status reports to endure you're actually doing something.There are things some ICs do that stood out to me, but most of the things that really stood out were positive, not pet peeves. Asking for feedback, communicating clearly, anticipating what work needed to be done, making me look good / making my job easier, researching and getting accurate data that can be used to drive decisions or persuade others that our decisions are correct.Managers want to do their jobs. Their job is largely to help you. If someone is thin skinned and doesn't take feedback well, that's a pain.Once someone on my team finished his work, and instead of asking me for more tasks said pretty publicly ""I'm getting bored, not a lot to do"" which makes me look bad.If your manager is any good, what is it you'd think a manager wouldn't be able to tell you? They should be giving you specific feedback on things to change to improve. If they aren't, ask for it, especially in specific situations like right after an important meeting/presentation.I guess once I worked with a woman with poor hygiene, and I imagine that negatively impacted her career, and I never felt comfortable broaching the subject.I was once surprised a direct report gave me notice she was looking for a new job (for personal reasons) before she actually found one. That kind of shocked me. She wanted to be fair, but that was more than just fair. I'd never tell a manager I was leaving until I actually had another offer in hand.

I think prototypes already exist. What if programmers could say what they want to do instead of typing it, and the computer voice recognition is so legit aka sophisticated and personalized (it understands coders' accents) that it writes your code for you? So you can say something like: in a new python script, create a list of fruits containing apples, pears, pineapples, oranges as a list, and your editor returns list_of_fruits = [""pears"", etc]. On top of that if you say ""the list of fruits"" in a sentence later while ""coding"" the editor knows to still reference list_of_fruits. And then when debugging you could say something like: what does the for loop at line 765 do, and in return you'd get an answer in a human language (vs python literally reading out a line of code back to a user), and it additionally pops up a visual of the components in other parts of the code changed by the for loop.
