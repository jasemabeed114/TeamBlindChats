0,Mar 11,"product doesn't stand out in any dimension, nor does the company as employer.There is a lot of players in that field now, some of which are which way more innovative and fast moving (Humio, Datadog to mention a few).Sumo is very similar to Splunk, but NOT better. The initial moat of sumo was that it is 100% cloud based (vs splunk which was on prem first and meant a lot of admin effort). Splunk is finally taking cloud seriously and hence there's no reason to choose Sumo over Splunk anymore. I'm familiar with both products and there's really not a single dimension where Sumo is better than Splunk, not even price (Pricing wise both are ridiculously expensive) .Humio, LogDNA, Scalyr are a LOT cheaper.Unless a miracle happens I expect Sumo to get acquired for cheap (maybe even by Splunk) in a few years to get their customer base, but that's it.",1,blanksheet,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Sumo-Logic-stock-buy-or-sell-isOSGFpk,Mars
1,Mar 11,Heard Splunk comes to $4500 per year while SUMO is around $115 per month.I did not like Splunk UI like 9 years ago when I used it. SUMO seems a bit better. But yes not sure where their moat is.I'm waiting for someone from SUMO Logic to share their thoughts.,0,PimplePete,/company/Synactive/,Eng,/post/Sumo-Logic-stock-buy-or-sell-isOSGFpk,Mars
2,Mar 11,unfortunately the pricing you mentioned is comparing apples to oranges.4500$ is I believe the entry price for an splunk enterprise on premise license.115$ is approximately the monthly list price per GB/daily ingest for sumo cloud. If you lookup Splunks cloud list pricing I believe you'll find some very similar numbers. Both companies target medium / large clients so the entry prices aren't that important anyways - what's important is how much they cost at comparable ingest volume and afaik they're very similarly pricy at scale. As a comparison scalyr list price is 40$/GB daily ingest (i.e. a third of sumo). Note that it's very common to get large double digit discounts for all of these vendors at scale.,1,blanksheet,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Sumo-Logic-stock-buy-or-sell-isOSGFpk,Mars

That‚Äôs how the ‚Äúcollectible‚Äù market will function in this digital space.But smart companies will abide by supply and demand and promote scarcity, because that drives up the value of the items in circulation and therefore attracts more attention....which is what they really want.

Then maybe others can get behind it.Right now, hr 392 has real opposition to it and the only people lobbying for it are Indian tech workers. It would be foolish to ignore the concerns of those who are opposed, very real concerns, and instead say 'go write a better bill'. Why can't you lobby for a better bill?At this rate this back and forth will continue and the backlogs will only grow, 10 year waits will turn to 20 and then more. In the meantime, USCIS is tightening the screws on h1-b and I suspect I-140 petitions are next on their list.",2,Egypt80,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Green-card-priority-date-8zpK7BmG,Mars
9,"Sep 13, 2018","There is no use trying to reason with this guy because he'll either talk about his Iranian friend on F1 (how is that relevant), say his non-Indian friends support this bill (either they are lying or he is) or say it's not fair that he is stuck in a backlog (yet wants a bill that when passed, will put everyone in a backlog).The goal here is to transfer inefficient bureaucracy to everyone. That should not be the goal. The root cause of the backlogs is not country caps but they have hijacked the conversation and made it all about country caps.Country caps were never designed to be hit, therefore if you have a cap on something but that cap is never met, the cap becomes irrelevant. Therefore the whole argument that skilled visas should not be subject to diversity would not be an issue if the caps functioned as expected I.e never get maxed out.Yes, it sucks to be in a queue that doesn't seem to move but the solution should not be to eye other queues but to fix the issue of the one queue not moving.Before 2007, all countries had a backlog, India, Rest of the World, all!Yet after 2008 the backlog of the rest of the world cleared up but that of India kept on building, why?Currently, India gets more green cards then any country. Infact, if you add up the green cards issued to European and African countries, the number is still smaller than that of India.This is something tactically not mentioned by proponents of this bill. The numbers don't add up, and that's the root cause.. Not country caps.One country gets the lion share of the green cards and is still backlogged so they complain that they want all the green cards. Even if they get all the green cards, they will still be backlogged.Why not talk about that, instead of hr 392.

6,Jan 2,"The only way to lose weight is by being in a calorie deficit ‚Äî so understanding your Daily Calorie Expenditure (DCE) is going to help you to understand how much you should eat (intake) in order to keep the number of calories below what you expend. It is as simple as that.You can find many online calculators if you search for TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and that will give you a good baseline to start.The best way to maximize gains and not starve is to combine a balanced nutrition (inside the range you need to lose weight) with strength training. Cardio is a nice extra but I wouldn‚Äôt bother so much about it if I were you at this stage.After understanding how much you can eat based on your lifestyle and how much you exercise, the best approach imho is to use an app (MyFitnessPal) to start tracking how many calories you are eating for at least 1-2 weeks. This will not only make it easier for you to keep yourself in a calorie deficit but, most importantly, it will educate you on hidden calories and what is actually healthy and a good amount for you to eat.You will be surprised that with this approach you can basically eat almost anything ‚Äî you just need to ensure you have a good macros balance and is not going after your daily limit.Good luck!

2,"Nov 17, 2017","I think the origins of ""diversity"" had good intentions. At Microsoft, there were several anecdotes, like the Tablet PC team showing writing recognition to Bill Gates, who is left-handed, and it failing miserably. Everyone in the dev and test team were right-handed.Someone saw a market in this. If you create a problem for rich companies that has market and possibly legal implications, they will throw money at the problem. Clearly, there are almost no women (or other minorities) working in coal mining. But nobody is asking women/minorities participation to increase in that sector. Meanwhile, even women/minorities that don't know how to code and don't like to work in tech are pushed into tech. Why? Because there is money to be made by them and the 'business around increasing their numbers'. It is not their fault: it is a business plot being well executed.Why this occurs mainly in tech? Because there are no regulations yet on who can be called a 'software developer'. You can try to push 13 years old girls as much as you want to become neurosurgeons or lawyers.

2,"Oct 19, 2018",Putting an employee on dev list is like creating a development plan for an employee whose performance is trending down and start a coaching plan. Upon coaching if nothing changes then they enter PIP or Pivot as its internally called. Unfortunately most managers struggle with managing this process and bungle it up badly for the employee. The employee is never supposed to be told that they have been put into a dev list. Managers should also not feel the pressure from their org leaders to push them to pivot and out of Amazon. An employee has a reasonable expectation that they will be given a helping hand and not kicked when down. There should be documented coaching efforts shown when an employee is going to be let go. I have managed a few people out and found it stressful. But I believe it should be.

In any other org worth its salt, their unprofessional conduct would be thwarted immediately. No - no support system at all from the HR except for some ""anonymous"" survey which was not anonymous in any way.Heck, I wanted to take (free) language classes offered by the company and the team/manager didn't permit me for literally zero reason telling there is too much work. They used to occur from 6-7pm, I offered to and tried to come earlier at 8am or stayed after 7pm (no-go if we're talking EU labor laws) but he still blocked me. Asked HR for help and they were like: nah, that's the way it is.I did have a sort of an individual at the same level as my manager (though his friend) from slightly different team who was very nice and adviced me a couple times on how to work on certain tasks, but (un)fortunately, she left quickly after I joined for her MBA at H/S/W. Working under her would have been terrific.
