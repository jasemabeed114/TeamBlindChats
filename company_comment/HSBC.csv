PE guy starts running transactions, observe and pitches in board meetings [TC 200-300K]5 yr in, corp guy might get promoted to manager. PE guy promoted to senior asso, starts getting carry in the fund. Knows CEOs and CFOs of many companies [TC up to 500K]10 yr in, corp guy likely still stuck climbing the corp ladder. PE guy is VP/ principal. Your‚Äôre still working 50-60 hours but at this point you‚Äôre heavily invested, people look to you for direction and decision. You are running businesses and have a team of juniors working for you.

When my friend and I were recruiting for IB out of undergrad, I ended up getting a PM internship while he got an IB internship at a top firm. After our internships, I got a return offer and got placed in one of the most prestigious groups at my company while he didn‚Äôt get a return offer and had to settle for an IB/PE gig at a 10‚Äìperson merchant bank. He‚Äôs slaving away for 100+ hours/week making a $120K TC while I‚Äôm working 45-50 hours a week and have a TC of $132K.
