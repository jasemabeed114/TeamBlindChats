Wlb is great, we are taking Friday off as a company and have a few times through the pandemic which is really nice.Teams are varied, some doing cross org or platform work and the majority doing user-facing, product focused work.Regarding the TPM or product move, it’s mostly up to the manager and their department you land in. It is a somewhat unique ask, so if that’s important to you, I’d make sure to mention it during the interview process.If you want construction industry knowledge, you would definitely get that. You’ll want to ensure your on a feature/product team though. Some of the platform teams are a degree further in separation from the construction domain.

Depending on what software/industry/support arm you’re in, I see a lot of Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and C++. There is a strong argument for Autodesk being the front runner in 3D software and with the SaaS model taking hold, projected revenue isn’t a big mystery. Investors love that.

0,"Feb 8, 2019","This is a biased opinion, but here goes.While the title change is probably going to be helpful to your career in the long run, be prepared for the shit show you are entering. Autodesk is a big, old tech company so lots of secrecy and everyone is more concerned with covering their ass than anything else. I know that exists everywhere, but the silos of information and general lack of communication makes things difficult.That and there are constant reorgs. One every year or so. They often don’t affect day to day stuff, but it can make it difficult to pin down organization goals or focus if the leadership constantly changes.Overall best of luck. I hope the move came with a significant raise not just in TC but in base pay. San Rafael is not a cheap place to live. The surrounding area is not mich cheaper either.Don’t get me wrong there are some good people around at autodesk, but the organization makes it hard for them to flourish. It’s all about who is the most visible not who gets the best work done.Stay safe.

3,"Feb 24, 2019","Which org / dept is it it in, without giving yourself away?Generally, I feel the revenue centers fare a bit better than the cost centers, but that’s solely based on my experience in DPE.Autodesk has a bloated middle. There’s a lot of middle management that is improperly structured or just bad, and not enough folks on the ground who are executing.Don’t know if it’s because of the reorgs (don’t think it is), but there’s a general lack of good decision making, poor collaboration and incentive alignment across different teams. The good news is that they do seem to be aware of this. The bad news is that they have been aware of this for months/ years now, and nothing seems to have changed yet although there is now a focus on it from CEO staff. At the end of the day, it is a 35 year old middle-aged company that is trying to transform into a cloud-first world (and struggling very badly)Now as a Director, you might have a better role and more power over defining that culture within your team. But so far, I have seen good people be dragged into the “Autodesk way of doing things” more than the opposite.I echo everything the above answer said. Especially that part about “Its a good company, but it’s painful to work for”.I feel like I have to fight the organization everyday for me to do good work.

6,"Nov 15, 2020","Sounds exactly like my story! Except I went through 12 months of pure hell and I didn’t end up in FAANG but instead with a semiconductor company which is still ok for me.I also just finished an MBA from a top 10 university in the US. It was really horrible bc I was so underpaid in my last job (base salary of 85k despite having close to 18 YOE) and was getting rejected from 700 job applications that I submitted over the course of the year. Meanwhile, I had to endure the pain of having to see nothing but constant LinkedIn updates from my fellow classmates, almost all of them who are 15+ years younger than me, way less experienced than me, and have absolutely zero tech background, reporting they secured a new position as a Sr. Technical Product Manager or a Sr. Marketing role @ FAANG companies. It really pissed me off that these kids who were so less qualified than me could just waltz right in and get these jobs so easily while I have struggled for the past decade to pivot from my former engineering role into a business-facing role.At first I was angry - really pissed off that everyone around me is able to get the job of their dreams but I cannot. I blamed it on my age and thought it was so unfair (it still actually is - I will tell you truthfully that Discrimination on the basis of age is PERFECTLY LEGAL AND CONDONED OR EVEN ENCOURAGED in this country.).Eventually, this anger turned into frustration. Then this frustration turned into severe depression to where I almost had suicidal thoughts of wanting to just curl up and die inside a life of solitude. I borrowed a ton of money to finance my education and am facing an enormous student loan debt. With such a shitty salary, how could I ever pay off my loans? Having such a huge student loan debt when you are in your late 40’s is embarrassing enough. The depression affected both my mental and physical well-being to the point where I developed an ulcer and was coughing up blood.However, after an entire year of absolutely brutal job searching work, taking on side projects voluntarily, enrolling in bootcamps, upskiling myself by enrolling in courses covering SQL, python, Pytorch, AI/ML, sensors, spending twenty hours a week extra trying to do mock interviews, preparing for case questions, and working literally 100 hours/week, I finally, I received the offer I mention above. It was like a dream come true for me and I literally cried tears of joy.This was over 10000 hours of blood sweat and tears for the past year.  I slept on an average of 5 hours/night. I had no social life for the past year and my weekends were spent working/studying 18 hours a day. I am a huge outdoors person and all of the hobbies (ocean canoeing, hiking, cycling) that I used to do were non-existent for the past year. In fact, even if COVID did not happen, I don’t think my miserable life in 2020 would have been any different.It’s really interesting but I’m willing to bet that many other Blinders, who are in their early 20’s, would look at the offer I receive and probably laugh or think it is below them. In fact, I recall hearing these privileged entitled little millennial shits from my MBA class mention that they actually received an offer from company I will join but they rejected it because the location was in the Bay Area or in TX, and they would consider only those companies that would allow them to live in sunny Southern CA next to the beach and palm trees or remotely. Many of them just straight up admitted that they would never work for a company that isn’t as sexy, famous and hip as Google, Amazon, McKinsey or Facebook. They said they applied there only as a backup in much the same way kids apply to “safety schools” for university.I can only imagine how it must feel to have the power to be able to dictate such petty and superficial criteria such as “I will consider only jobs that will allow me to have work next to a sunny beach” when looking for work. I can’t believe these people can’t realize that 99% of the world would kill to have the jobs that these people reject based on such asinine and petty criteria. They simply seem like entitled spoiled but very qualified children.Some even laughed when I told them i applied here as one of my top choices and that I would literally give up my left arm to be able to get an offer from this same company that they ridicule and look on with disdain.However, for me, it is my dream come true and it represents not only a year but over a decade’s worth of painstaking brutal work. I have been trying to obtain a product marketing/manager role for the past 10 years but was always met with rejection. However , now I finally did it and I can say with pride that my hard work paid off.Although I think this offer and job position might seem completely stupid and petty to many others who enjoy the luxury of being able to have things happen so easily for them, to me, it is a dream come true and the value is worth a million. I am thankful for finally being able to get the job of my dreams, even if it is not a FAANG company and have the wonderful support of my gf who stuck by me through anf thin and encouraged me when I felt like giving up and throwing in the towel.Happiness is all relative.TC: 240K",68,panda1971,nan,Ops,/post/7-months-of-unemployment-to-FAANG-4VYDJqRb,Autodesk

Then see how well you get accepted into any other culture and how praiseworthy other culture/races really are.You being stupid and an Indian does not mean everyone from your country is also stupid.Do not damage it for lot of good folks just because of some bad folks.I have worked with several Indians in my life and they were all great chaps.

5,"Mar 3, 2019","Let's say it takes ~3 years to IPO, if you're lucky. In that 3 years you'll have made likely $900,000 more at Dropbox ($270k higher pay x3 and round up with perf reviews). How strongly do you feel that startup equity will be worth more than a million bucks? At 200m in sales I gather they have several hundred employees, probably 500-700. So you're not a foundational hire. Your equity could devalue if they raise more capital. The title is nice tho. And LA is better than SF (to live, perhaps not career wise). Its a tough call.

If this is managed by some other team you're SOL.Anyone can do CI/CD and release management...but not everyone can do it right.
