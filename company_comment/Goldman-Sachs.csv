It‚Äôs all about constant repackaging and rebranding of products to make it look like we‚Äôre doing something new.Here‚Äôs a great example: we were all given a 1.5% raise due to the pandemic. All travel was cut and the funds were used to raise the dividend while the CFO said ‚Äúwe need to focus on our shareholders‚Äù.

Since you have been there for only 6 months , which is nothing so you don't want to burn bridges and be black listed. If Microsoft doesn't care and you are free to rehire in future, make the move now for better salary but then stay with amazon for 3+ years.Now you have to think here. Staying 3 years at amazon means you will not be getting salary bumps you would think you deserve.If I am in your shoes, I will stay at microsoft for min 2 years. Take 1 or 2 promotions.

8,"May 28, 2019","@ruminate: To help you give some correct information1. Salary range is very wide for VPs, there are junior VPs who are more like team managers on the lower end and then there are Tech Fellows who are on the seniormost end. They are equivalent to Executive Directors and manage large functions within Technology space. You can research more about the pay on level.fyi, but for a tech fellow it is on the higher end of a VP salary range. The only change you may witness vs Google is that bonuses for us contribute to a large proportion of our pay.2. Next level from Tech Fellow is MD and base for minimum MDs in GS is 500k no matter where you are located, bonuses become bigger part at this stage. Basically the higher you go the more bonus will become a huge part of your pay sometimes 2x - 3x.15 yoe is common at MD stage.Hope this information helps.10,000+ people work in Tech and most of our leadership is from Tech (Marty Chavez is an example, Google him)Hope this helps.",2,secdb,/company/Goldman-Sachs/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Goldman-Sachs-tech-salaries-ofXeQULo,Goldman-Sachs

3,"Dec 8, 2017","I spent several years at GS before joining Amazon. Here is my personal take on it:(1) As a technologist, you‚Äôd be respected much more at Amazon. GS is ruled by finance guys namely, quants/strats and traders. It is fairly common for people in finance to be promoted to MD with less than 10 years of total experience, but the same is virtually unheard of in technology and operations. They also put huge invisible barriers for any one trying to move into quant roles from technology.(2) Secdb used to be cutting edge, may be a decade ago, not anymore. GS desperately wants to move away from slang/secdb now, but they are so heavily invested in it already that they are finding it very difficult. You would hardly find any secdb specific teams in GS who use any of the latest open source technologies which you know of. You would seriously risk getting out of touch with latest technology trends unless you make a conscious effort to keep yourself abreast with them in your free time.(3) GS as a firm is well past its prime now. It‚Äôs days of being considered a coveted investment bank are more or less over. It is mainly because of some extremely restrictive regulations applied on investment banking industry (post the financial crisis)which prevent them from taking huge risks, which they used to take prior to 2009. Less risk means less reward. Just read about their results in the last 5 years and you would know. For that matter the whole investment banking industry is going through a bad patch, I think.(4) the compensation philosophy of GS is to keep the base quite low, and pay mostly through the year end bonus, which is highly variable. I‚Äôve seen people whose TC decreased compared to previous years due to low bonus. Even if they are giving you a 40% hike on base salary, most likely, you would only see a very marginal increase in base year on year. Even if they want to pay you more in a particular year, they would give  you extra bonus that year.(5) Most people who join in technology, straight out of college, become VP in 5-6 yrs (average performers who stay that long). In most teams you would find 3-4 levels of VP hierarchy- VP reporting to a VP, who reports to another VP and in many cases that guy reporting to another VP. Just ask any of your friends there, in case you doubt this. MD is a really big deal. In my opinion VP ranges from L5 to L7 levels of Amazon, while MD in GS is comparable to L8 in Amazon, and their Partner to L10+.Having said the above, things vary from person to person, and between teams, regions etc, so please take it with a grain of salt :-).",10,frodo1,/company/Amazon/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Leaving-Amazon-for-Goldman-Sachs-aCJ2MwHZ,Goldman-Sachs

1,"Nov 9, 2020","@SREEEEEYour 2 main products are CC & Auto loans. And the legacy code at C1 i was talking about is in python. 95% of the teams at GS dont use slang and the teams that do usually hire math majors anyway, we also have entire divisions built on AWS and full CI/CD etc. Such as transaction banking, Marcus, GS Bank etc. But we also do low latency java, low latency cpp many teams use Scala or Python extensively. My point is yes some slang team at GS might suck more than a legacy team at C1, but the upper tier of tech teams at GS is much much higher and the domain is much more interesting and relevant to other functions in finance such as hedge funds and HFT. The AWS cert you get at C1 takes a month of self study and GS hosts training sessions for that cert as well. Also C1 does not open the same doors into other lucratice areas of finance nor does it carry the same brand recognition. I feel that any person thats thinking about the future of their career should pick GS. Also McLean, Richmond & Plano all suck NYC, SF, SLC & Downtown Dallas are much more fun places to be. Also the existence of Slang (although you don't want to work with it) proves the capabilities of GS they created an entire language and ecosystem to interact with securities and blew everyone else out of the water because of it.",2,ZaddiLloyd,/company/Goldman-Sachs/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Capital-One-vs-Goldman-Sachs-SQSVRJXh,Goldman-Sachs
2,"Nov 9, 2020","Maybe we both have misconceptions of the other companies. CC is a major product of ours but Auto Loans are only in Plano. Payments for us is becoming a large space and has pretty transferable skills to other payments (PayPal, Square, Stripe etc). Majority of our applications are written in Golang or Java, where Python is more used on the infra side. I heard that Slang is used a lot at GS but I don't work there. I think interesting is pretty subjective. If your interest is in Hedge Funds or Trading then C1 doesn't have as much opportunity. But we have a growing ML practice in fraud detection and Eno, excellent data science, a modern SRE/DevOps practice. AWS cert being self study is inaccurate. There are plenty of training sessions and time off given for preparation. C1 definitely does not have the brand recognition in Finance, but is known for being one of the best banks from a tech perspective (Plenty of Citi, Amex, JPM etc. alumni that like it here better). Also C1 is at all of those locations as well except SLC. I work in NYC.GS is definitely capable and would be great for OP if they're trying to position themselves in a career in HFT and Securities. But I think the breadth of possible experience at C1 would position someone to jump to a FANG+ better than GS. We've had all hand meetings with Sr. Dirs to specifically address attrition to FAANG. I am working towards such a jump myself (interview with FB and G scheduled for late Nov and early Dec) and feel like C1 has really helped me with touching a lot of different tech and learning it well. Plus the benefits, WLB and co-workers are excellent at C1. Probably great at GS too though.

4,"Oct 13, 2018","I can't speak for Marcus specifically but in general I would suggest joining to boost your resume and leave after a reasonable amount of time.  I do have some advice for you to be a bit more prepared.The politics are way more intense than other corporations so being good at what you do matters very little (unless you're the only person on something important).  Even if you're on a team that is the exception to the firm's culture, you will still have to deal with other teams(the lying, BS'ing and witch hunts to shift blame).Since only the best political operatives survive, you will find very few reliable people who knows what they're doing.  So as a product manager who has questions (especially bugs) on a product, find the actual person who did the work(not the person who claimed to have worked on it).  Most likely a consultant or contractor did the work and if you're lucky or have a good relationship, they can give you an honest answer.  Due to politics, a GS employee 90% of the time can't give you an honest answer even if they wanted to.Newly hired people are good resources too because they haven't fully been integrated with the culture yet.  So they can be more honest until they get slammed for openly admitting that there's a bug or they just admit to not know something rather than lead you down the wrong path.Comp and work life balances are generally low compared to tech firms.  Work life balance depends on your manager mostly and odds are good that they will want you to sit in your chair until at least 6pm everyday.  It's pretty much embedded in the tech culture here that sitting there late doing nothing shows that they're doing something.  Image is always going to trump actual results.",2,OWWG73,/company/Goldman-Sachs/,IT,/post/Marcus-goldman-sachs-FmR1OJGi,Goldman-Sachs
