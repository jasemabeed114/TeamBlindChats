Changes on the product display page can take two months for a sml change after some teeth pulling and if you are lucky, then you need to have a successful and convincing a/b test.In some divisions like classifieds which no longer exist, pms didn't really have much say other than taking marching orders from the GMs.  It was all about SEO as there was a clear lack of focus on apps as the leaders there had zero understanding of products.

I do know people for whom eBay was an awesome experience.  So YMMV.The one thing I'd like to point out is that eBay is not a retailer - *other* people buy and sell on eBay.  For an instance of where this makes a difference - let's say you're based in California and you want to buy product X.  X is sold by sellers all over the US.  How do you rank the sellers ?  By price, by seller reputation, by seller location, by how long it has historically taken for the product to ship between your location and the seller's, by shipping method supported etc. etc.  It's a pretty fascinating problem. Your customer is not just the buyer - it is also the seller.  I suppose etsy has a similar problem space. Some parts of Amazon too, but, they have other big areas.I totally love my job at Tableau - my team, our mission - everything.

8,"Jan 18, 2018","Adobe!Here’s my completely biased opinion backed up with numbers:We've had Huge recent gains. Someone already mentioned that our stock has gone up steadily for the last few years, but let’s put that in terms of revenue:FY15: $4.8B FY16: $5.9B FY17: $7.3BWe are a 35 year old startup. Our TAM (total addressable market) went up from 64 –> 84B last year. We lead in many of the areas where we compete and still our total revenue is &lt10% of our TAM.I’ve been around at Adobe for awhile so please let me know if you have any specific questions.",3,MikeD,/company/Adobe/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Yelp-Okta-eBay-or-Adobe-eCEZ7jDD,eBay

Have been internally referred but from other posts here on Blind, sounds near impossible to get a recruiter response. I’m keeping my fingers crossed to hear back. ;)",0,FITUMI,/company/Cisco/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Yelp-Okta-eBay-or-Adobe-eCEZ7jDD,eBay
