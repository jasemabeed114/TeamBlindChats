I do know people for whom eBay was an awesome experience.  So YMMV.The one thing I'd like to point out is that eBay is not a retailer - *other* people buy and sell on eBay.  For an instance of where this makes a difference - let's say you're based in California and you want to buy product X.  X is sold by sellers all over the US.  How do you rank the sellers ?  By price, by seller reputation, by seller location, by how long it has historically taken for the product to ship between your location and the seller's, by shipping method supported etc. etc.  It's a pretty fascinating problem. Your customer is not just the buyer - it is also the seller.  I suppose etsy has a similar problem space. Some parts of Amazon too, but, they have other big areas.I totally love my job at Tableau - my team, our mission - everything.
