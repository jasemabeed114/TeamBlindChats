2,"Aug 19, 2018","I hear what you're saying about the level of the question, but pushing back on a question that's been asked of you is generally death during an interview. Answer their questions as best you can. Rock their world. At some point they should ask you for your questions and that's when you start respectfully probing on the expectations for the job. If they never allow you to ask questions then that's a super bad sign.FWIW, I have not heard super great things about Space X. Work you hard with low-ish pay.",6,th47,/company/Fitbit/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Interesting-interview-experience-at-SpaceX-w4OH7Try,Fractal
3,"Aug 19, 2018","@th47. No, no, as I said, I don't mind questions. Stupid or tough. If they asked, I could answer a lot of stuff a newbie doesn't know. For example why quick sort is not the best choice for almost sorted data. Or that in contemporary std sorting is not quick sort. But it was more than just questions.But I understand what you are saying. And I disagree that we should not push back. How they treat you during the INTERview (inter means both ways, right) sets the bar for how they will treat you if they hire you. If they don't give a shit about your opinion now, they won't in the future. We should not be beggars. The company should be. They should show the respect and the interest should be mutual, not like: we are making you a favor, you disagree, then eff off.Otherwise the corporate culture that treats developers as expendable crap won't change. They need us.",3,rotel,/company/NVIDIA/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Interesting-interview-experience-at-SpaceX-w4OH7Try,Fractal

5,"Aug 19, 2018","Not even surprised. Same shit happens in tesla. Here is how it goes.Shit recruiters find candidates who don't fit the job description I.e a front end guy to work on compiler optimizationsü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAll of a sudden the team gets tons of unqualified resumes. So now you either spend time coaching these dumb ass recruiters to find proper candidates I.E do their job for them or create a take home test to weed out unqualified candidates .Often times the manager is too lazy to create a good take home test, that tests what they are looking for. So the manager will either ask the new grad on the team or steal a take home from a different team and hand it to the recruiter.The dumb ass recruiters will send this stupid test to everyone who applies. Even good candidates with 30 years of industry experience or candidates who have a full time job. That's how you ended up with this test.",12,LEETCODER,/company/Tesla/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Interesting-interview-experience-at-SpaceX-w4OH7Try,Fractal

8,"Aug 20, 2018","Peeling potatoes at the interview doesn't end at the interview. I have two master degrees in engineering yet I'm expected to be a technicians gofer because they are too cheap to hire enough people. Salary is free goes the SpaceX motto.After going through an interview if 1 person out of 20 doesn't think you're a fit then you don't get hired. Or funding drys up b4 the candidate signs paperwork so your SOL. It's a an act of elon to get any one though  the hiring process. By the time we get 1 person though at least 1 has quit.For the MS peeps: Elon hates you. Almost everyone he fired in Seattle were former MS employees.
