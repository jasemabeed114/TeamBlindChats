Do take note that the tax free allowance of 12.5k is reduced by 1 pound every 2 pounds earned over 100k. That causes a marginal tax rate of 60% on every pound earned over 100k, because you‚Äôre suddenly taking pounds that we‚Äôre never taxed and taxing them, and then also taking the new pound earned and taxing that. This stops at 125k when you no longer have any tax free allowance.Add the Employers NI for RSUs and your RSUs can be taxed up to 67%. Read the article, it breaks it down for you.Contributing to a pension means that that money isn‚Äôt taxed and your taxable income drops by that much. So if you‚Äôre currently at 123k, contribute 23k to pension if you can so your taxable income is 100k. That will save you from a high marginal rate of taxation.Do up an excel sheet if you must.

3,"Sep 22, 2018","Cap One TDP offers are non-negotiable. On the plus side, 100K is above the norm for the area and way more than what they used to give 2-3 years back. Your joining bonus might easily be 10K and performance might add another 6-7K for the base Associate level brining the first year to around 115-120K.Not bad. NoVA is weird cause you can get an apartment that is expensive if you're near DC or you can go a little out and get something cheaper compared to other west coast areas. People club DC and many parts of Virginia as the same COL but honestly, they are vastly different if you ask me. Traffic can be a bitch though. Still don't think it is as expensive as western states if you find the correct spots so 100K is very decent money.As far as CapOne is concerned, TDPs get good exposure and you'll get 2 teams in 2 years. Work culture is fairly chill. What you learn varies dramatically depending on your team. Sometimes you end up with crappy horizontal tool maintenance or other times you end up in a position where you get to own and create new apps/core features. I feel there is good talent in patches and the company has a good focus on CICD and tech streamlining in some LOBs.Not a bad place to start off honestly. Performance management is like most other companies.

1,"Nov 9, 2020","@SREEEEEYour 2 main products are CC & Auto loans. And the legacy code at C1 i was talking about is in python. 95% of the teams at GS dont use slang and the teams that do usually hire math majors anyway, we also have entire divisions built on AWS and full CI/CD etc. Such as transaction banking, Marcus, GS Bank etc. But we also do low latency java, low latency cpp many teams use Scala or Python extensively. My point is yes some slang team at GS might suck more than a legacy team at C1, but the upper tier of tech teams at GS is much much higher and the domain is much more interesting and relevant to other functions in finance such as hedge funds and HFT. The AWS cert you get at C1 takes a month of self study and GS hosts training sessions for that cert as well. Also C1 does not open the same doors into other lucratice areas of finance nor does it carry the same brand recognition. I feel that any person thats thinking about the future of their career should pick GS. Also McLean, Richmond & Plano all suck NYC, SF, SLC & Downtown Dallas are much more fun places to be. Also the existence of Slang (although you don't want to work with it) proves the capabilities of GS they created an entire language and ecosystem to interact with securities and blew everyone else out of the water because of it.",2,ZaddiLloyd,/company/Goldman-Sachs/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Capital-One-vs-Goldman-Sachs-SQSVRJXh,Capital-One
2,"Nov 9, 2020","Maybe we both have misconceptions of the other companies. CC is a major product of ours but Auto Loans are only in Plano. Payments for us is becoming a large space and has pretty transferable skills to other payments (PayPal, Square, Stripe etc). Majority of our applications are written in Golang or Java, where Python is more used on the infra side. I heard that Slang is used a lot at GS but I don't work there. I think interesting is pretty subjective. If your interest is in Hedge Funds or Trading then C1 doesn't have as much opportunity. But we have a growing ML practice in fraud detection and Eno, excellent data science, a modern SRE/DevOps practice. AWS cert being self study is inaccurate. There are plenty of training sessions and time off given for preparation. C1 definitely does not have the brand recognition in Finance, but is known for being one of the best banks from a tech perspective (Plenty of Citi, Amex, JPM etc. alumni that like it here better). Also C1 is at all of those locations as well except SLC. I work in NYC.GS is definitely capable and would be great for OP if they're trying to position themselves in a career in HFT and Securities. But I think the breadth of possible experience at C1 would position someone to jump to a FANG+ better than GS. We've had all hand meetings with Sr. Dirs to specifically address attrition to FAANG. I am working towards such a jump myself (interview with FB and G scheduled for late Nov and early Dec) and feel like C1 has really helped me with touching a lot of different tech and learning it well. Plus the benefits, WLB and co-workers are excellent at C1. Probably great at GS too though.

0,"Jul 22, 2018","I am on my way out of Capital One actually. Some reasons why:1. Company has no respect for SF office. the CEO refuses to visit us and there is virtually no leadership in this building. The VP in charge of SF was fired a few months ago and then they tried to tell us that she had planned to leave for several months... Yeah right then why did they have a meeting last minute?2. Constant restructuring, in the last 12 months I think two large orgs were disbanded and most of the employees laid off. Halo, Small Business, all gone and their projects all got taken to East Coast. 3. Low quality code base, really bad coders who just cargo cult and make the problems worst because they don't care to be responsible4. You're an Eng right? Uber is monopoly money but C1 doesn't do equity grants until you're a Director so your TC will be even lower than it is now5. I heard Uber got rid of stack ranking, well... bad news. CEO loves it and thinks it's the best system. Many of my good friends and quality talent leave because of it.6. Performance management is about marketing yourself as a 1000x rockstar developers instead of any quality output, so forget about anything but politics. Seeing you are from Uber... It might be a good fit?7. Last week someone in my org sent a farewell email calling out the CEO for never visiting... and our VP who is also never visiting decided to fire him and have security remove him from the building for it.My advice... just don't do it.",56,KNABRIAF,/company/Capital-One/,Eng,/post/Whats-it-like-at-Capital-One-xMXaHY04,Capital-One

Behavioral interview is important, but if you don‚Äôt pass the case, it won‚Äôt matter how well you did in the behavioral.While you will have to get the case ‚Äúright‚Äù, you will still be evaluated on other things during the case such as your ability to maintain composed under pressure, the types of questions you ask your interviewer when seeking more information, etc. Keep in mind your interviewer will start by giving you just enough information to get you started, you can - and are expected - to ask questions. Your interviewer wants you to succeed, so take advantage of this. I think what really helped me was talking through my thought process aloud even as I was writing out the math to figure out the formulas. Leverage this as a method for also giving your interviewer insight on your communication skills. Your interviewer will help guide you - listen intently. The candidates who fail despite the help/steering of the interviewer are the ones who don‚Äôt realize that the interviewer is actually trying to steer you towards the correct answer.

I don't work at INTC anymore so could care less. But intel was good to me and despite the haters the logo on the resume goes a long long way.

4,"Jan 10, 2020","I, admittedly, haven't worked for either (yet), so I am just basing this off what I've read online and heard from people. I hear a lot of hate about both Intel and C1 here, especially from a SWE perspective. From what I understand, the issue with Intel is that a lot of the software work is in direct support of the hardware product (ie, optimizations for Intel-specific hardware), which is good experience but has the potential to pigeon-hole you long term. Also, C1 is a Fortune 100 company and have been pushing hard to make themselves viewed as a ""tech-company"" (queue the desu memes), so it definitely has some brand-recognition in this area.That being said, I do agree that Intel has better brand recognition in this industry and having that stamp on a resume would definitely help get interviews down the road. I honestly feel like either option would have been good for me, especially since I am an RCG.Also, out of curiosity, how long were you at Intel and why did you decide to leave?",0,KMFD26,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Intel-vs-Capital-One-TDP-6ah7pMvv,Capital-One

1,Jan 30,"Offer is decent. About what I used to get paid when I became a SA. Also this is blind so you'd probably find more negative than positive reviews. Here is my opinion...Living situation: The rent drastically differs depending on where you stay. McLean/Tysons is a decent area but very commercial. Most youngsters gravitate towards Arlington where rent could be closer to 2K for a 1BD. Reston is a pretty neat spot as well if you don't mind a 20min commute and rent would be cheaper than Arlington. If you move further out, you can find a place for real cheap but it all depends on how much you want to spend and willingness to live outside the city.Work: Very dependant on the teams however most follow good software practices and at least the trend is towards a tech companyesque environment. Most teams choose their own stack so it could range from Java to Python to Javascript. We've even had some exotic ones with Go/Scala/Clojure. Ideally you would want to be in a customer facing division like card or bank which impacts the bottom line for more visibility. Avoid the horizontal division in my opinion.Perks & WLB: Perks are great. A really good 401K match along with most teams having an honor system with regards to vacation days. Most managers don't bat an eye if you use more as long as you're a good team player. WLB is honestly very chill. Most Fridays are just folks logging in and joining meetings until 12 and then just taking off. When we were in the office, we had free snacks and drinks in our pantry and I really miss that. Overall, a chill environment.Bonus: Bonus is linked to rating (5 levels). If you get a Strong (think Level 3 aka average), you'll get the 5.5K which is usually what most get. Stack ranking so if you're in the top 20%, you'll get a much higher cut. Really depends on how well your manager sells you at the end. Honestly my only main complain with C1 is their stack ranking policy.Overall, I feel it is a decent company to work with. Like any other place, it depends on your project/manager at the end of the day.

2,Jan 30,"Apartment cost wise you will find the further west you get from McLean the less expensive. The closer to DC, the more expensive. Reston and Ashburn are common places for folks to live. Traffic volumes are down due to covid, but if you want the option to use metro to commute, take that into account in your apartment search.Feedback from my directs is that McLean rents have dropped significantly due to pandemic.Regarding performance ratings roughly 35% exceed expectations (10% exceptional, 25% very strong, inconsistent 5-15% and the balance are strong (meets expectations).Exceptional will get max bonus (2x meets expectation value). Inconsistent will get 0.5-0.75x meets expectations value)The experience is what you make of it. WLB is good, but there will be times where you gotta do what you gotta do to get stuff done.

No kids don‚Äôt know) paternity leave, on-site doctors, unlimited sick days and 3 weeks PTO with more added every couple years. We have good relationships with our product teams and they invite us to all their outings and fully sponsored happy hours (sometimes even at the office) atleast bi-weekly. Fully AWS and generally encouraged to experiment or try new things. MacBook pros and whatever setup you want. Also, to be more clear to those out of the loop, the ‚Äúmore pay than principle associates piece‚Äù we‚Äôre talking about all cash $160k here for 4-5 years experience at Principle Associate which is low when compared to tech companies, but not super low when compared to the bulk of the industry.",7,BoxOut,/company/Capital-One/,Eng,/post/Capital-One-is-Hiring-NEYtemoK,Capital-One
