Pay is one thing but job satisfaction is also important, you mentioned you liked ms better, so consider that as well.My suggestion : Try to negotiate with ms to get more stocks, current stock is what L60 gets, if that is not possible you should decide based on what you have now. I see that you mentioned differences in brand, job satisfaction, culture and TC. You should weigh these and decide if one is worth the other. Depends on what matters more to you.Think from growth perspective as well, how soon will you get to L62 in MS vs SDE-3 in Flipkart, and what'll be the tc over-all over the next few years, and what if you pick one now level up and jump to the top of band in other one  after ~2-3 years.Also, if possible try Amazon also, they pay much better, learning wise also it's comparable to the offers you have but you'd have to sacrifice on wlb a bit.

1,Mar 27,"I'm part of Flipkart search team.First of all let me tell you that Flipkart is not how it used to be couple years back. Don't know the exact reasons but looks like upper management totally focused on IPO readiness and other things are going for a toss. And FK is paying very less these days compared to market standards. Even appraisals are so bad that you won't be able to even beat inflation LOL (mostly it's single digit, even for EE rating).Coming to the search team, it's actually one of the best teams in Flipkart (comparatively). Team is pretty mature and problem statements are interesting. You'll get good opportunities in ML, big data, scalable systems etc. I've learnt a lot here. But again the thing is everybody is leaving Flipkart and search team is no exception. Lot of good folks who have been with Flipkart for 4+ years have left recently. Most of the team members are new and whoever old ones are left, they are prepping to move out. Not sure how the next couple of years will look like. There's change in upper management as well, so pretty hard to guess how things will turn out.If you've decided to join Flipkart, then search team is good option. But if you're still interviewing, you can find better opportunities easily. Money matters! If Flipkart continues to pay 🥜🥜, the tech team quality is going to drop drastically soon.Happy to answer if you have any particular questions.",4,flopkart,/company/Flipkart/,Eng,/post/Reviews-of-Flipkart-search-team-HWqjEKzp,Flipkart

But managers have good visibility for future work and it feels like a slightly democratic place where leaderships ask for feedback from time to time and people do ask the hard questions.Overall, its quite stable and decent work, good if you want to have more me or family time, no obvious downside.Some people moved to ekart from our group recently, so it should be decent as a group.As for comparison with msft, they definitely have a better brand, more facilities and chance to move to us - but the sentiment here is that msft isn't necessarily good for your salary and the kind of work depends.

0,"Apr 19, 2020","I would happily switch places for 75L salary in India :-) On a serious note, a Friend of mine moved to Bay area leaving a 50L per annum salary in Hyderabad, India. They are a family of 4 - 2 toddlers & spouse does not work. Based on my conversations with him, Consider these factors:1) You/spouse should do all the household work - dishes, cooking, laundry, house cleaning. My friend had 2 maids in India - one to do all household work and another one for cooking. Forget about having equivalent domestic help in bay area, unless you are ready to spend atleast $2K plus at the very minimum2) He had a chauffer driven car who would drop kids to/from school/daycare and also drop my friend to office at times. This is almost impossible here in USA3) He stayed 30 mins away from his parents and would meet them atleast once every week. THIS would become once a year or so from USA - with the worry of H1 extensions and H1 Visa stamping for India travel. Folks staying here cant goto India as and when they need/wish without all the cobwebs of H1 Visa.4) You/your family will be throwing away all the social circle/friends you have in India and start from scratch over here.5) Once you are here and stay for sometime, it will be difficult to go back especially for kids - schooling system is different in USA and India. Your kid/kids will find it difficult.I'm not discouraging you from coming here. But the above points are first hand experiences of a couple of my friends. The friend who moved from Hyderabad went back to India in about 15 months of staying in USA. Luckily his previous company welcomed him with open hands.You can surely make/save more money but it comes with an expense of comfort of life. I personally feel that with a high TC life is/will be more comfortable in India with an added perk of staying close to family/friends.",32,tXpa21,/company/Persistent-Systems/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Moving-to-US-from-India-TBM3xjXX,Flipkart

Unless you get an H1B and directly join US office, you will move on L1 and that has few problems that most folks don't realize until they move here. 1 - You will be handcuffed to the company until you get H1B (some get it in first attempt, for some it takes 3-4-5 years too). 2 - moving on L1 means, the employer won't give you US based new hire equity grant which is easily 150 to 300k per year. Hence your comp will be only base+bonus and you will slowly catchup with the equity part with refreshers.

8,"Apr 19, 2020",Here's the scenario for you (I have thought about the same thing multiple times)Company - AmazonRole - SDE 3TC - $280 -$300 ( They will lowball since you'll be an internal transfer. Ex Amazonian here)Once you're on H1B get a tranfer to a different FANG (mostly Google since you can then move back to India) for higher TC and stay the course of your visa and move back once your visa expires.Assuming a 300k TC and a 33% tax rate and half your post tax TC going into expenses you'll save up close to INR 75 lakhs per annum. This ofcourse increases since you can expect a promo/job change in those 6-7 years you spend in US. You basically come out saving 5 Cr+ at the very least even without your wife having to work.Bonus: G and Amazon let you keep you US stock grant when you move back to India. Which means your TC will be crazy high even when you move back to India.It makes sense to move if you're planning this for a medium term (6-7 years) and doing it strictly for financial reasons.,24,zrkM03,/company/Google/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Moving-to-US-from-India-TBM3xjXX,Flipkart

12,May 13,Have you tried calculating the roi? Do rough calculation of1) house with emi with interest - at the end of 15-20 yrs (adjusting for real estate increase) - Value of the house2) invest emi minus rent into an MF and get the total savings at end of 15-20 yrs - value of savingsMay be it'll help with the decision.,0,b.excited,/company/Booking.com/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Should-i-buy-a-house-now-JjgrDMw6,Flipkart
13,May 13,I did that calculation and it turned out that if you are renting for more than  10 years then it's better to buy a house. But the problem is liquidity.  24 is the age of trying a lot of new things.

3,"Dec 28, 2020","Flipkart is also mostly standardised with react as the framework. Internal UI teams are not that good - but public facing teams like mweb, desktop, seller, (and maybe even ekart) will be good for learning. Also, lot of focus on react-native in various teams.",2,flipped,/company/Flipkart/,Eng,/post/Best-companies-for-Front-End-Roles-in-India-2021-FGmsepyv,Flipkart
4,"Dec 30, 2020","I am in a internal team - somewhat bad code quality, bad learning, but super good WLB. In general, i think wlb is pretty good across the company - but might vary with team and due to wfh . Specially new teams might have more work. Stocks is pretty useless. Buyback is about 15%ish, and stock growth is not much,also very less stocks allocated compared to other big companies.Base is basically all you have, so neg that well. Don't accept jb with stupid terms like 2yr return period. Increment is usually 8% annually, usual 10% bonus is always given (ME rating). Not much benefits otherwise.",0,flipped,/company/Flipkart/,Eng,/post/Best-companies-for-Front-End-Roles-in-India-2021-FGmsepyv,Flipkart
5,"Dec 30, 2020","Also yes, that sde2 range sounds correct. Some internal promoted employees end up getting even less than 25. I would say 5yrs is probably not enough experience for sde3 - typically people need more (but there are some people who get promoted every yr or so, normal people need 2+yrs between promo)",1,flipped,/company/Flipkart/,Eng,/post/Best-companies-for-Front-End-Roles-in-India-2021-FGmsepyv,Flipkart
