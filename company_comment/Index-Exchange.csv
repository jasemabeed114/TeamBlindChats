4,"Jan 22, 2018","I don’t see how this saves you money when you get into the next tax threshold.Tax brackets are progressive. You’re only paying the larger amount on the delta that exceeds the prior threshold.AMT is a bit more complex so let’s table that for a bit.From a purely bottom-line oriented position it’s always better to pay the tax.If I owe $1000 in tax, a $1000 charitable contribution still leaves me with a $670 Tax bill (at the 33% bracket).Sure I feel good about helping the Red Cross but I still have a $670 bill to pay. Total out of pocket becomes $1670.Note: I feel I need to note that I support charitable giving.

5,"Jan 28, 2018","When you donate appreciated assets you don’t pay capital gains on the appreciation. As an example in your scenario: If that $1000 that you donated originally cost you $100 (e.g. a stock grew 10x), you wouldn’t have to pay capital gains on the $1000, and would reduce your tax burden by $330.Total out of pocket after paying the taxes is $670 (remaining tax burden after donation) + $100 (original cost of the appreciated asset) = $770.Sure, in this scenario is not a lot, but there potential to reduce taxes while doing a good deed.Again, it all depends on your individual circumstance, and it may not beneficial for most, but there are some that could benefit.",0,IyaJ67,/company/Apple/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Diversity-without-tax-impact-h6ye6Awf,Index-Exchange
