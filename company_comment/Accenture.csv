Anyway there are a few of us who stayed on and moved around.  With Amdocs expertise are you in B‚Äôham?  Anyway, you can make your way, but honestly the first year may be difficult.  I was a Director and used to running things my way and had to adjust.  I spent a long time at level before finally being promoted to Sr. Mgr.  That‚Äôs right a BellSouth Director = a Manager.  Have not made MD, but also kind of stopped trying for that.  All ATT fire sales of their people to Accenture are ‚Äúour mess for less‚Äù or ‚Äúhire to fire‚Äù.  Later when the ATT merger came along I was privy to conversations that made it clear.  You will have to prove yourself and it will be annoying.  The transition experts Accenture sends in are just there to execute the plan.  They are just slamming it all through with whatever minimum effort it takes to meet the SLAs.  Be dependable and flexible and don‚Äôt be the slob who asks all the hard questions in large group meetings.  Trust me you won‚Äôt get answers - they keep it all high level.  You are now part of a business case.  Don‚Äôt take the package as everyone who does will be looking for a job at the same time.  The Accenture name will be very valuable if you want to keep working elsewhere in a couple years.  Act like you want the job, figure out who needs your expertise and make sure they look good.  Accenture is waaay more a meritocracy than it used to be and much more sensitive to diversity.  You don‚Äôt have to be some jerk in a blue blazer to succeed anymore.  Your Amdocs skills will only go so far, so be ready to skill over into something else, and don‚Äôt expect Accenture to lay it out in a path for you.  Benefits are great if you have a family and you can make a decent work life balance if you aren‚Äôt trying to make MD.  More later.

Even on a), McKinsey Digital typically may advise the CIO/CTO on roadmap and vision, while Accenture supports on executing that roadmap. Both critical, but operationally different ‚Äî high vs low margin, few vs many consultants on the ground, serving the CEO/CIO vs CEO/CIO-1/2 and so on.Digital McKinsey is indistinguishable on culture, prestige, compensation.

3,"Oct 5, 2019","Having worked with people from the middle East and Europe while at Accenture here is my advice.Yes you are taking a downgrade in title but if your goal is to head to Accenture to learn how to Execute / deliver large projects then the trade off is well worth it.You are getting a downgrade in title for two reasons.  The EU has a huge backlog of highly skilled people who want to make manager.  This means that in some countries it will take a person 8 years to make mgr.The other reason is that a mgr in Accenture is expected to be excellent at 1) technology 2) project MGMT and 3) business / client development.  They should also be able to handle just about any sitaution.  One final point about expectations, you are expected to do this in the manner that Accenture delivers work.  Not the way you did it at your old company (this is what makes them good at delivering globally large projects).My guess is that you have the tech well covered.

That's why they're so picky.I originally wanted to do consulting, but saw how elitist some people were and decided to go with tech instead. I ended up really loving tech and now I can make more than most consultants, with less experience, while working less hours.Regardless though, the fact of the matter is smarter people tend to go to better schools, and recruiters have limited time. This is why it matters what school you go to - so it gives you that benefit of the doubt. (I wish I could tell my 18 year old self this when I didn't apply to a single Ivy League because I didn't want to go to a pretentious school and ended up going to the whitest and preppiest school out there...)

Politics to either have someone else to blame when it goes wrong or another voice in the room give the ideas credibilityFor tech companies its mainly 1 & 3 that i heard of happening.Depending on the type if engagement those companies can add a lot of value but generally pure strategy is just a recommendation and plan they got from talking to people at the company.

2,"Nov 11, 2019","Subset of SWE. All depends on the company honestly as data engineering is a new field that emerged the last decade. Generally speaking, data engineers do SWE/DBA/some BI and analytics work.DBA work: They‚Äôre responsible for ensuring the quality and timeliness of data pipelines as well as the stability of platforms that analysts and data scientists use. Should be really damn good at optimizing queries in big data environments.SWE work: Lots of data work is still hand carved through Excel and SQL, so DE‚Äôs leverage as much automation as possible through code to make everybody‚Äôs lives easier. This automation could be scraping API‚Äôs, basic file traversal/parsing, building out an easy-to-use service to DS‚Äôs/DA‚Äôs don‚Äôt have to run SQL or code to push their data. Some DE‚Äôs operate entirely in the big data processing space and with EMR/Hadoop/ etc., in which case they‚Äôll generally live and work with Python/Java/Scala. Last but not least, DE‚Äôs do a lot of meta coding to gauge health and efficiency of all cross platform processes, from reporting on individual database metrics to compute/time costs of long-running overnight processes and jobs.BI/analytics work: DE‚Äôs help build out reporting and analytics platforms and need to be really damn good at data modeling. They understand more than the average SWE (in my experiences) how the business operates. Sometimes they have to write the SQL or code that generates reports the business needs. This is not as important as the DBA/SWE work above IMO, but is still needed because generally you‚Äôre embedded deeper with the business than SWE‚Äôs are.^ not all comprehensive, but just a general overview.
