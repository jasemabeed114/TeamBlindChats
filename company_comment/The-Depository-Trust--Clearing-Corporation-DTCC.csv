2,Feb 1,Np - I've learned from my time at uber how fast misinformation can spread. Get used to inaccurate headlines like the $40 to appease workers.

8,Jan 31,Linkedin seems to be currently employed with robinhood. What you are missing is robinhood might be facing solvency issues. Do you recommend people to keep it as a custodian of your shares with the current situation. May be keep some speculative money in that account and transfer rest to genuine companies like fidelity.,0,prdg,/company/Workday/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Full-explanation-of-the-GME-RH-and-Citadel-debacle-QBSUbgz7,The-Depository-Trust--Clearing-Corporation-DTCC
9,Jan 31,"What a load of BS. GME isn't the first stock in the history to go parabolic. TSLA has been going parabolic for years, was it ever restricted? What about people who had cash sitting with RH that was settled for days? What about people who got liquidated without ever using margin? What about CNBC falsely declaring shorts closed pre market precisely when a disinformation campaign and a short ladder attack was being engineered? If RH cannot manage capital requirements due to volatility in a small market cap stock, Vlad should shut shop and go home. Stop trading on all stocks, not a partial list.""Citadel securities and Citadel are different entities"" lol Ken owns both, and he needs money to buy another Picasso. He also partially owns RH and bailed out Melvin Capital for no apparent reason. You have to get really high on CORPO koolaid to declare without any insider knowledge that there is no conspiracy here. Rot in prison, Ken. You are probably too rich to face any consequences but a man can hope",4,jsuhf384,/company/Comcast/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Full-explanation-of-the-GME-RH-and-Citadel-debacle-QBSUbgz7,The-Depository-Trust--Clearing-Corporation-DTCC
10,Jan 31,"@HomeStreet thank you for your support. I know Vlad may have seemed not very eloquent in his news performances, but internally we all know how much they've worked to build this company up and how much they actually care about the mission. They precisely left the establishment because they saw that no one cared about millenials' money, spent three years just building out the initial product. I wasn't there then, but I can't imagine how cash strapped they would've been, not to mention the scorn of Wall Street. I'm personally proud of wsb, and I think it just shows how the financial world is going through a huge change. And I personally believe that rh played a major part enabling that, which is why I'm just an eng who joined recently(&lt2 years) but am very passionate about what we've accomplished and what we have for the future, and also have been very saddened / frustrated by the name-calling. Sorry for the rant and I'll probably stop posting on Blind now lolz",4,aOl10pX,/company/Robinhood/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Full-explanation-of-the-GME-RH-and-Citadel-debacle-QBSUbgz7,The-Depository-Trust--Clearing-Corporation-DTCC

12,Jan 31,"An additional point: I've seen some people comment on how we could've just allowed users to buy with settled funds, not instant. However, the clearing requirement is unrelated to the user's transfer settling, but is related to how trades are performed in pseudo real-time (which happens because the account is a margin account). So all/any opening of position increases the requirement, and is not bound by instant. This thread sums it up well: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25950659. In addition, the fund has to be paid out of rh's pocket, not users' deposit. No sane company has billions or tens of billions additionally floating in their accounts in normal times as that would be terrible management of funds. No one saw that this would escalate so quickly, which I can confidently say from seeing the explosion last week.",12,aOl10pX,/company/Robinhood/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Full-explanation-of-the-GME-RH-and-Citadel-debacle-QBSUbgz7,The-Depository-Trust--Clearing-Corporation-DTCC
13,Jan 31,"With all that said, i do feel sorry for the employees who weren't part of this decision making process and have to just live with it like the rest of us. I lost my trust in 2020 when we experienced problems closing trades for 4 straight days for hours during covid crash where i lost actual money but got offered a 75$ giftcard instead. Moved to td but as a tech enthusiast, still have my robinhood account with petty cash and small positions. Even back then it was called black swan saying they weren't ready to handle such volume while changing things in backend. This is second curve ball resulting in strike 2 and honestly these kind of reactive strategies would work everywhere except this one field:fintech. It's the harsh truth. I hope negative PR will subside like last year, over time and hardworking employees do get their reward!",1,mojojojox,/company/Veritas/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Full-explanation-of-the-GME-RH-and-Citadel-debacle-QBSUbgz7,The-Depository-Trust--Clearing-Corporation-DTCC
