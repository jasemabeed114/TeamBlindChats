0,"Nov 21, 2020","I came in via Sendgrid acquisition, but I was new at SG.My take is Twilio is very documentation and process driven design culture. A lot of making briefs to propose something, shopping it around, getting approved, then eventually working on it. Pretty heavy and somewhat slow moving. I also found it very PM-centric and IMO often at the expense of actual users. Common scenario would be to conduct some research and have the PM interpret it their own way or ignore to push for a different direction via politiking / backchannels. Comp growth is quite slow.The good is the team is chill, people are all very nice, WLB is very good, benefits very good, lots of variety of products, company growing, RSU growth was great the past couple years.
