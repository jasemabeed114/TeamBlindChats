10,2d,"The salary offered is significantly high for a candidate from Tier 1 college. For example: A fresher having an IIT/NIT tag will be offered a minimum of 16 LPA+ and PL10 level. Compare that to a person from a non premier college with 3 years of experience will only be offered 10 to 12 LPA.So what I am trying to say is scale of salary over here is different depending on the college you studied in.In general salary growth over here is around 15 - 20% every year on average, atleast in DH, with occasional correction of about 30-35% every few years.Overall there is good WLB, but at times it gets messed up due to the acute talent shortage (but still better than a lot of companies). For the first time I have seen a lot of genuinely good people at one place compared to the previous companies I have worked in.Anyways good luck in the salary negotiation. If you really feel HR might be willing to give more, then please feel free to negotiate. Atleast try to negotiate some other components like the joining bonus or the retention bonuses.PS: A lot of people still get half the tc with 10+ years of experience within the company  :p",0,tfct06,/company/Siemens-Healthineers/,Eng,/post/Siemens-India-Offer-Evaluation-Kgmzb35f,Siemens
