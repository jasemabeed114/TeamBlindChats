8,May 16,"current employee at Roku (but planning on leaving soon hopefully for Netflix where I have an onsite in 2 weeks)NO ROKU IS NOT A HIRE & FIRE/SINK or SWIM COMPANY ! By no mean ! (and that might be the issue) lodwvxjj is right (I know who are you talking for the director of product who got fired and who ended up getting back to Google his first name starts with A), but those are exceptions.Below is the truth about Roku :Roku doesnt have a culture (like Netflix for example) with no (real) memo defining it, no processes (no performance evaluation, no feedback of any sorts outside of your 1-1s, no promo/raises ...) or no/little events/club/perks etc.Therefore at Roku, more than anywhere else, your boss is ""the culture"" and YMMV on how you get treated since anyways there is no other performance evaluation process . That said, the expectations for employees here is VERY LOW, many of them are coasting/lifers while making tons of money thanks to roku stock 10x ing in 2 years and they are not even trying to pretend that they care.Let me set that straight : if Roku was a company that was incline to fire people, employees would get slaughtered left and right. (per my previous gig culture/expectations 35% of Roku employees should get fired (and I would include myself since Roku taught me to do the bare minimum) )Also for the same reasons mentioned above (your boss can do whatever he/she wants with you) it is very political too. So some terminations are on the arbitrary side, but overall you have my word that Roku is a secure place (just be a good soldier who say yes to people in which case you can work there 10 years and easily get away or even progress while working 35hours/week and make decent money)Pros/cons to work at Roku VS NetflixPros: -job security/I've heard Netflix firing-machine gun is for real !-low pace/low pressure (this being a pro depends on your ambition, but Roku typical employees enjoy that)-WLBCons:-Netflix comp is untouchable (though Roku starting TC is good too in a sense, but keep in mind that there are no raises at Roku, and stock is unlikely to 10x again)- Roku employees tend to be older/have families, they aren't passionate about their jobs anymore. Those people don't encourage innovation/disruption cuz that would mean more work for them. Working at Netflix is probably a lot more exciting/engaging.-Resume : Netflix is the top, Roku is mehhh-AHRAB - ALL HR ARE BASTARDS ! Everyone at Roku I spoke to hates HR.-Roku boss roulette make sure you spend time to grill your hiring manager during interviews to make sure its a match.

Having been through a number of acquisitions in my career, I can safely say this is one of the best I have been a part of.

This was done in the open with extensive input and participation from members of the acquired company.  We quickly established an aggressive roadmap that would integrate the two stacks and have never looked back. A lot of effort went into preserving a positive culture and in stamping out any ‚Äúus vs them‚Äù mindset or other toxic behaviors that can sometimes develop after an acquisition.To be clear, the pace is fast and the expectations are high, but compensation is excellent and the quality of people you get to work with is exceptional.

2,Mar 13,"There‚Äôs a lot of misunderstandings around compensation.  Comp is salary + stock. There are no bonuses.  We manage to a total comp number, not just the salary component.  Compared to our competitors in the marketplace, our comp is aggressively rich. The issue that people bring up is that the salary component rarely increases.  This is true but misleading.  We conduct compensation reviews twice a year.  It is not uncommon for us to raise people‚Äôs comp target - it‚Äôs very common in fact.  If actual take home is under this revised target, you will receive a salary adjustment.  This scenario is rare for the good reason that the stock has been going up - a lot.  Net/net everyone‚Äôs comp has gone up a lot these last few years but nearly all of it has been in stock value.  It‚Äôs hard for me to see this as anything but a good thing but it does require that you see things through the lens of all-in compensation.

3,"May 22, 2020","Depends how you look at it. Roku continues to be #1 in the US and our recent earnings have proved that we are recession friendly company because people are adopting OTT and dropping cable.However, our leadership is very weak. They are very conservative. There is practically no Innovation here. Our daily job is onboard new steaming apps. As the world moves towards OTT we continue to onboard more streaming apps that benefits our consumers.Our hardware products are great. We have figured out a way to build amazing hardware products for low cost. It takes years and years to get it right.However our user facing products suck.If you are a Netflix, YouTube or Disney user, it doesn't matter if you wanna stream on Roku or Fire or Apple TV. We have no differenciation in comparison to others. Infact we lack there significantly.Take a look at Roku search. It feels like it's being built by interns without any supervision. It's a really crappy experience. Not sure why PMs and engineers still have their jobs for building such a bad product.Look at our voice experience. An 8 year old can build a better experience with open source NLU libraries than a big fat team here.Look at our sign up experience and compare with Android TV or Apple TV. It feels like we have no idea what we are doing with it. Same thing with some other features on the UI. Our homepage experience is same as it was 6-8 years ago. Nothing changed because people are just too scared to introduce changes.Our ""flagship"" product 'The Roku Channel' is so confusing that no one knows what we are offering within the channel.Roku keeps getting lucky because we are in right place at right time. But how long will it continue ? At some point, this will collapse. Our competition will take over because they have Innovation in their DNA.Our VPs are extremely arrogant. They live in a bubble and have no idea what's happening with competition. They are too busy collecting their RSUs and options. If someone wants to do something great, they are fired immediately because it requires adequate hardwork that they don't want to invest.I feel bad for some great people at Roku having amazing ideas but they are scared to openly discuss because of fear of getting fired.Our culture is full of fear. Lots of hire and fire for tiny or no reason. Thumb rule at Roku is never never never break big people's ego. No matter how smart and amazing you are, they will purge you out next minute if you don't agree with them. Recently saw some great people being let go for no reason or for standing up themselves.Roku has racist culture. I see folks from India (on H1b) being treated differently vs Americans. They are given separate treatment when it comes to letting go.Every VP and Director spent 4+ years at Roku should be fired. They are just resting and vesting and carrying huge egos in their head.Yes, we are in a bubble and it will eventually burst because Apple, Amazon, Google and Samsung are our main competition and they will squeeze us in few years.Look at stories on the web comparing Fitbit with Apple watch and how Apple just killed Fitbit in the wearables market. Same with Blackberry failed to adopt Android, stayed in their own bubble and eventually died. I have not come across a single user who is a Roku fan.

Now we are basically innovating to reach ARPU of 50. So when we already have the user base, we need to monetize that. The new innovation will not be very reflective or visible as it is in Ad business which is not visible to users. But believe me when I say - all ads will be streamed, we are getting ourselves in a great position to get all the $$$ when the companies will start running their campains on OTT in the future.

3,Jan 21,"This question makes me think that Roku's growth prospects are still high, even after the phenomenal growth it went through (almost 30x growth in the stock price in 3 years).To give you an idea about Roku, consider following.1) Roku is the leading streaming platforms in US. In addition to Roku's own hardware devices, more than 1 out of 3 smart TVs sold in US are running Roku OS. Almost 15 TV brands make Roku TVs.2) Our competitors are Amazon, Apple, and Google. Facebook is also trying to enter the market with Portal TV but its negligible. Interest from such heavyweights does indicate the size of market opportunity, and yet Roku is the leading platform till now. More than 51 million households (active-accounts) use Roku OS.3) Most people think of Roku as a hardware company. While it is true that the company started as a hardware company, over time it has pivoted into a Platform. We make most of our money from the platform business. Hardware is almost at break-even.4) International expansion has just started. We recently entered Brazil and Europe. Huge potential there.5) Lots of traditional TV companies are shifting their focus to streaming. The future of TV is streaming, and Roku is where streaming takes place.

Their 4K capable device is just $50.As others have mentioned they're a massive advertising platform because they own the platform in the same way that Apple and Google own their platforms. This drives most of their revenue. They also make money from device sales and from a cut of the revenue generated by apps/channels on their platform. Just like how Apple and Google get a cut of smartphone app revenue.If you've used Smart TV apps (particularly budget TVs) you know that the quality/speed/reliability/etc of these platforms and apps are pretty terrible. Roku solves this by having devices and a streaming platform that works beautifully. They are the standard streaming platform that all streaming app developers build their apps for.

3,"Apr 28, 2020","OP - Congratulations on offer. I used to be at Apple before moving to Roku. It depends on what you want long term vs short term benefit. For short term - Roku is looking better because you get cash upfront but remember stock refreshers at Roku don't exist. No 401k. Health insurance is really expensive. Maternity / paternity is bad. HR doesn't help you with personal issues. Your fate is practically being held by your manager or VP of your org.If you are going to work for old timers at Roku, I would suggest don't even think about coming here. Old timer VPs are way too arrogant to work for. Also, you cannot move to other team at Roku. They don't have culture to grow people professionally. It's going to be a hit or miss opportunity. If it's a miss you are screwed. If you are on H1b you are even more screwed. Also, current circumstances for H1b are not looking good.Apple lets you move internally within different teams. Refreshers are really good. If you perform well you can get up to 100% of base in refreshers every year. Add bonus, 401k, better health insurance on top of it.if you get promoted in future, you are looking at more money.Most importantly you will work at cutting edge stuff at Apple. Roku is 20 years behind in tech and you cannot sell this experience anywhere else.ML is either Search and Recommendations, Ads or Voice team. Unless it's ads team, don't even consider other teams. Those teams are being run very ineffeciently.At the end of day, decide if you are in this game for short term or long term.",9,Dr Trump,/company/Roku/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Machine-Learning-Engineer-AppleSeattle-vs-RokuSan-Jose-eECtUqVz,Roku

4,"Jun 6, 2020","I never understood Roku's stock rise and business justification. They are going after 60B TV ads business but more than 90% of consumption on Roku is due to top tier apps like Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Disney+. I highly suspect if roku gets revshare except placing remote buttons. Maintaining these services + cloud costs must be too high to justify the margins. Infact Roku must be begging to these app providers to place them on their platform.Rest of their apps are trash and probably focused on certain age population.I find it very hard to imagine that their so called free version of AVOD has so much viewership. Just look at their experience. It's so bad that I almost puked one day.See Tubi and Pluto experience instead. It's so nice and clean.They have some ads business (that they claim) but significantly lagging behind the likes of Facebook, Google and Amazon. I highly doubt if advertisers would like to consider Roku for their campaigns.If Roku announces streaming hrs split by non revenue making vs revenue making apps, I am certain stock will tank to $15 (IPO price).Roku has zero international presence despite of being in business for so long. This is exactly where they are going to fail because they don't understand international market.Fitbit failed similarly. They operated on their own and Apple scooped up the entire wearables market.Tivo had good days but stock crashed by 90%.

They need to do a lot of damage control to avoid a decimation of their valuation and they are likely going to lose money for decades while they keep levaraging and setting their dominance (a la Amazon)...
