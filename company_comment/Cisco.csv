Microsoft is huge company and much more political than Cisco. I experienced very toxic culture and very shitty managers in microsoft. Azure networking as you mentioned is right, lot of work is SRE.Reason being networking has had too many outages and new features have been reduced significantly. Risk is you push new features, do some config changes and sev2s/1s/outages increase. So focus is on stabilization, automation etc. So many people do not like it. Less good work causes too much competition amongst devs and stack ranking gets worse. As I see ms is offering 43 base which is much lesser than 55 base in cisco. DO NOT fall for 30L Rsu. Because i guarantee you will lose on bonus as cisco gives target + IPF whereas microsoft gives target/2. Unless you get 1 Cr as your spouse rightly mentioned , it is not worth to take all bad work and toxic culture.

The more realistic possibility is that you had an open headcount not filled by a certain time and ended up being taken away.This is the reality of top tech.At least in these companies worries about operating costs aren't a concern for a HM, unless you are a director / VP level guy hiring for your immediate reports.Source HM at FANGMULA.",0,minimm,/company/DemonWare/,Eng,/post/Desperate-to-get-out-of-Cisco-eg8AW4Ro,Cisco

9,"Dec 18, 2020","A lot of people are going to show up at interviews with similar skill sets.What sets you apart:- knowledge of the market, the opportunities, the company, the competitors- understanding the problem space and speaking to your strengths that can get the company there - your ability to build relationships and work with teams. This requires you get out of your own head and show an appreciation of team goals that you were a part of - demonstrate that you are a good person ie talk about the things that motivate you If you come off too prepared then I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs genuine.Just free flow and really let the other people get a feel for who you are as a person.Remember:- no one knows everything, so it‚Äôs important to feel comfortable not knowing, anything can be learned- exhibit some quality that the job fits into some life passion rather than you just wanting to work thereThe world is a big place. Opportunities are endless. Revise your definition of success. It‚Äôs not by a TC, it by waking up everyday knowing you are making a positive difference in the world and you are still blessed. Go do some charity work so it grounds you. No one is promised tomorrow. The grave is the equalizer regardless of TC. Start with giving thanks for all the things you have right now. Your energy will shift and people around you will feel your good vibes.Good luck to all in life.Steve Jobs had the biggest TC and died alone.Find meaning and give thanks for the challenges in your life that allows you to explore and grow you you really are as a person.Peace and love to all.üôèüèæ",30,aiPH24,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Desperate-to-get-out-of-Cisco-eg8AW4Ro,Cisco

3,"Jul 19, 2017","Cisco used to be hard working but positive and fairly enjoyable. Then it just became hard working. Most everything JC promised, and we all worked extra hard for never happened . It just became a culture of hard work including international hours and obligations, and little good spirits. People left, quit, or got fired/reduced/right-sized. All the good feelings were gone and that is nearly impossible to get back in a large company culture.I left in 2012 but just a month ago I had a friend leave after, oddly , 13 years. I asked why and what it was like . He mostly echoed the same things, which tells me the culture could not have changed that much. I am sure there are some pockets and places in the company but I'm pretty bearish on them. In a pinch if I needed the job would I work there? Maybe briefly, but I would be planning on an exit the day I entered. Are there other companies like this? Sure. But I work at a small 1000 person govt contractor where the pay is a little less, but I work regular hours and they treat me better without being fancy.I, like many, worked a lot of long hours without nearly any thanks as it was just 'expected'. Compensation went way down to just a flat paycheck and medical got worse. But the work stayed constant and the culture was chronically  'frustrated' with a strong negative tone. Once near the end of my tenure JC finally sent out an email stating how the company had a strategy of acquiring and then cutting resources. That explained many things we had experienced . My package when I left was not justan insult but hurt my family as well as it was far less than any traditional level . I know one or two folks still there but most of those as can be expected were from the old days riding tenure. I've met people at my last two companies since along with some outsiders that had been at Cisco and pretty much the are bearish on th√©ir experience too. Maybe someday I will meet some bullish folks but that day has yet to come.",2,EQBp33,nan,Ops,/post/Cisco-Meraki-UMuhNNgH,Cisco

1,"Sep 30, 2020","The ""rules"" include ""CCP can compel any Chinese national to produce any prod data they have access to at any time"".This is why you see nearly all companies having separate VPN, data centers, LDAP, etc... for their China operations. Most even terminate SSL in Singapore or Hong Kong (and tunnel into China) because we can't even trust the China-based CAs and network infrastructureRecently we started seeing web apps forced into dedicated .cn domains, which by law must be registered to a PRC national. Presumably this is to provide a way for CCP to even access things like user cookies or inject scripts.So, ""the rules are clear"" is not entirely telling the story. These rules are designed to defeat user privacy and security. Many companies bow out because they're unwilling to put their users in a bad position.In the case of LinkedIn, we have a very different product in China that's missing things like DMs and anything else that a user might expect to be private.

8,"Jul 15, 2020","@sLsq47 It is great that you acknowledge discrimination is real. Now when you say that there is no benefit of doubt, I can only say that there can be situations that something is taken out of context/comes off as offensive. My response to it is that, so many micro-agressions have been normalised in India (same case as anywhere else in  the world) and there can be stereotypes that even perpetuate it. I think as a person who doesn't intent to wound the other person, the first step is listening, understanding why it is offensive, apologising and making a conscious effort to not do it, call others out when they do it. I know all of this is hard, but I am just applying the analogy here, it is not sufficient to be just not racist, we have to be anti-racist if we truly believe it has to end. Similar with casteism. Again excellent point about the last name part. But a few questions to ponder over. If caste isn't a big deal, why do we still give it so much importance in the form of having it in last name ? Why do so many arranged marriages within India happen within same caste/ caste groups that are considered equivalent ? Like I have told you, not giving a fuck about caste is not enough. I was once like that during my undergrad days, until someone called me out saying, it is indeed my privilege that I can not give a fuck about caste.

0,Jan 19,you are in cisco already ?I tried for meraki and process was weird (not standard).They pulled up some of their repo and asked me to implement a functionality. Question were very hard to understand with convoluted language.,0,drift4,/company/Microsoft/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Cisco-Meraki-final-interview-SvJRxRo2,Cisco
1,Jan 23,Sorry there is nothing but bad experience with Meraki. I would suggest try elsewhere. HR called me 3 times (i was unable to pick up due to meetings) just to tell me that I was rejected. I posted a bad feedback for her as part of interview review. I normally dont do it. Also they need to setup time to either give me some honest constructive feedback or just send email. This phone drama is just too much.,0,drift4,/company/Microsoft/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Cisco-Meraki-final-interview-SvJRxRo2,Cisco
