0,"Jul 5, 2020","I'm confused.  Mark founded CZI and has agreed to give 99% of his wealth away via the Bill Gates giving pledge (he's already spent a ton on COVID research and disease in general).  Why's that a bad thing?  Hasan likes to exaggerate quite a but and few know his sister works at Google.  So hence he has these tech hit pieces often but never on G which is hypocritical.Also, at least Bezos doesn't hide it.  Bezos is one of the few that hasn't agreed to give much of anything to charity, let alone 99% of wealth.",11,higsdf,/company/Facebook/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Shameless-Business-tactics-how-do-you-feel-iZxqoH7Q,Nestle-Waters
