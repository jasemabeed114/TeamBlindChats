Live in most any neighborhood close to Manhattan (including in one of the other boroughs) and it's easy to get anywhere. Yes it can get cold in winter and humid in the summer ... Idk it's weather you deal, in fact the hole city changes from season to season. Rooftops and patios in the summer. Mulled wine and hot toddys in the winter. Being the city that never sleeps there is always things to do and lots of events coming to the city. Lastly my favorite part: new experiences tend to find you on the street. You just walk into the most amazing wine bar or spontaneous street band... Things that are harder to do in LA where you're in the car constantly and everything is a bit more closed.Idk LA just never gave me that. In the end it's a personal choice.

3,Yesterday,"I lived in SLC for more years than I care to acknowledge. Happy to be out. It was never my kind of place, but it had a lot more going for it than many cities that size. It has sports and arts -- there is a lot of culture in SLC, but you have to spend time there to know that, and opera, ballet, musicals, plays, the symphony, museums, concerts, etc. have to be your thing -- and many fine restaurants and bars as well as endless opportunties to engage in outdoor activities and a thriving tech startup culture.I was your age when I lived there for the second time, and I met my husband there. SLC skews non-Mormon now. You can find friends and dates; you just have to look around for the people you click with. Joining hiking groups and such enables many young people to find relationships. There is also a vibrant counter-culture in SLC, as one often finds in repressive areas.I also lived in Denver, and I would choose SLC over it. They are similar, but Denver, while more laid back, is ultimately more a sports-based city. It seems more alive on the surface, but for me there were fewer options for cultural entertainment and so far less to do.I also lived in Evergreen near Golden. It was nice to have access to the city but to live in the mountains. You can have that in SLC, too, though. I lived about 2,000 feet above Salt Lake Valley on top of a mountain. The climate was significantly different to the point of being novel, and it felt remote while still being accessible. I was also steps from hundreds of mountain trails and cross-country skiing.SLC does suffer from terrible air quality much of the winter. It's among the worst in the nation and often the world. There have been times I literally could not see my hand in front of my face, and sometimes people wore masks inside the buildings pre-COVID to protect themselves from the smog. I lived above the inversion, though, which is an option. Since you are remote, you can live and work above it.SLC itself suffers harsher winters and hotter summers than Denver in addition to providing fewer sunny days.The state itself is fighting the fact that it's slowly becoming more non-Mormon than Mormon. The Mormon culture asserts itself strongly at times to try to hold onto traditions. That culture wasn't my thing, but it's also something I was able to live with for years by largely ignoring it and living the way I chose to.",2,blindabcs,/company/Microsoft/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Move-to-Denver-or-Salt-Lake-City-fhwpkB65,Citi

If we had not found ex-Mormon friends we would have been pretty lonely. Things are slowly changing and SLC is better than Utah county (which is South of Salt Lake).Also, OP, if you don't like ""deep red areas"" then Utah is not for you. The conservative nature of the state has kept its taxes much lower than most areas of the country.

6,Apr 26,"I cant comment on your budget. But a good or bad roommate makes all the difference in my experience.Generally, all my roommates have been friends or acquaintances who I can generally trust to be calm, collected, and financially secure. I would interview any prospective roommates to see if we have compatible personalities. (for example, I usually like introverts like me who like to cook and share food every once in a while.) That doesn‚Äôt mean we need to have the same interests. The roommate only needs to be pleasant enough to talk to and be around.Oh and it helps a lot if each gets a separate washroom to take care of, in case that roommate turns out to be a slob.I also have a cute cat that my roommate takes care of for me when I need to travel for work or vacation. Which is a relief from things like hiring a cat sitter.One final thing is to discuss and create a roommate agreement for things like expectations of general cleanliness (kitchen and washroom standards, etc), guest rules (advance notice, length limits, etc), pet rules (vacuuming, litterbox upkeep, emergency plans, etc), division of chores (who takes the trash and when, vacuuming common areas, etc) and the list goes on. I find even if this isn‚Äôt enforceable in many cases, it does get the conversation going on how to deal with conflict as well as set a standard/expectation for how living together would be.I found in my experience it is super important to be clear on the stuff above.

2,Jan 1,"I lived in both cities.....London of course is (or at least feels) more vibrant than Amsterdam because it is much bigger and crowded, it‚Äôs definitely a city with endless options in entertainment, culture, career etc, similar in lifestyle to NYC, and it is also more diverse.However I have to say that, while living there, I‚Äôve also wondered several times what all the hype about London as a lively and exciting city was about. The main things that killed the whole ‚Äúglobal lively capital‚Äù thing for me were opening hours and distances.Everything closes so damn early compared to continental European capitals or NYC. There are a few clubs that stay open until very late but they are not many and you have to like clubbing, you definitely won‚Äôt be able to just chill with your friends in a cool bar/pub until late, something which is super normal for example in Berlin or New York, the cities where I had lived before moving to London. Same thing for having a bite late at night, after 9:30/10pm you‚Äôll start having a hard time finding a table in a good restaurant and after midnight even fast food is hard to find except for a few McDonald‚Äôs that are open all night (this is shocking to people living in Berlin or NYC). I had high expectations for this to change with the start of the Night Tube (24h subway at weekends, which again the other cities I mentioned have since ages ago) but there was only a very slight improvement. All of this obviously doesn‚Äôt matter much right now during a pandemic but we can only compare pre-Covid lives and I guess we can assume things will more or less go back to how they were before even in terms of local culture and preferences.As for distances, London is just so big and spread out that it takes forever to go anywhere and this, in my experience, takes a huge toll on your social life. It‚Äôs hard to meet, plan things and hang out with people that don‚Äôt live in your area. While this is more or less true in every city, it‚Äôs literally taken to the extreme in London (for example I find NYC way more compact and easier to navigate). Despite the excellent public transport infrastructure, you‚Äôll find yourself in the end rarely getting out of your area and almost never going into central London (the part that every tourist usually gets excited about). Going to a different area will feel like a small trip, which is great for weekend explorations maybe but honestly takes a toll on you in your everyday life (let‚Äôs not even talk about the awful commutes, since for now you won‚Äôt need to do that at least).Overall I enjoyed my time in London and I still love it but these two factors greatly reduced my excitement for living there and the appeal of the city for me. I think Amsterdam, relatively to its much smaller size, punches well above its weight in terms of being lively and an interesting/fun place, while also being a much less stressful city where to live",14,hyyms,/company/Uber/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Better-City-London-or-Amsterdam-i21pH612,Citi

Or, you can stay where you are and take it easy there and maybe even work part time (other extreme). Both are feasible. Or you can find some sort of middle ground. My general advice is, do what feels right for you and your husband, have the kid when you feel is the right time and then make everything else work around it (ie, don't postpone having a baby because of a job). But also don't forget it takes a while to get pregnant and then it takes a while to give birth so you are probably at minimum 1 year away from even actually having the 2nd kid .. 1 year being demotivated and bored would be too much for me personally.

My heart was crushed when the recruiter said no :(HRT has great perks and is chilled out by HFT standards, but some people don't like that top performers don't get paid as much relative to Jump. More selective than JS as far as I can tell.JS bumped up their pay by a lot this year from what people are saying on Blind, but it's a much larger company which to me is a negative, and having wasted a bunch of time on Slang at GS I feel like OCaml doesn't sound very appealing.Citadel pay is really good, but sounds like it has a lot of unpleasant features (still hoping I get an offer though lol, I'm poor as f).TS pay is not very impressive compared to the rest, and is also a huge company now.",39,fake engineer,/company/Goldman-Sachs/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Take-you-pick-which-NYC-firm-M38ArT8c,Citi

3,"Aug 1, 2020","Seattle has failed to handle the growing population twice now, that's why Boeing moved it's HQ to Chicago back in 2001. And that's why Amazon has been moving most of its operations to Bellevue and HQ2/other US tech hubs.It is not a city which is going to prosper due to it's aversion to outsiders, gloomy weather 8 months of the year, lack of an innovation vibe as well as geographical limitations to its expansion.Just some time before the pandemic, Seattle had started charging Jersey City or Boston rents and would have matched SF rents this year if the pandemic hadn't happened. It was charging these rents as if it has the opportunities of Bay area and the transit and vibe of NYC- but in reality it had none of these.The only thing which has worked in Seattle's favor is lack of a state income tax, but that comes at the cost of bad weather 8 months of the year, homelessness and poop on streets, smell of marijuana throughout downtown Seattle. Because hey, there is no state tax so income has to come from things like legal marijuana.Seattle sucks the happiness out of you after a few years of living here. Even if you have close friends here and make plans with them, and even if you live like 3 blocks away from them, most plans get cancelled, Seattle freeze is real. Agreed it has beautiful outdoors, but very few days in the year when you can actually enjoy those outdoors. Fewer days to enjoy the outdoors mean a very tight tourist season (June-Aug), so everything is going to be crowded and expensive during that time.I would recommend Seattle more of as a 2 year city at max, enjoy everything it has to offer and move somewhere else before it sucks out your happiness.Personally would prefer places like NYC, Boston (great combination of seasons, good for people who love snow) or Denver (most sunny days, mile high city, great outdoors).SF is good to visit but Bay area in general is too bland and dry.",12,klH792,/company/Amazon/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Favorite-tech-big-city-ukYZJJpZ,Citi

So you‚Äôre not losing anything by buying.In the end it really depends on your circumstances. It‚Äôs not necessarily a good investment as most places have high monthly fees on top of a mortgage. It makes sense instead of renting so you can get at least some equity when paying those high monthly costs regardless. I bought 7 years ago and it‚Äôs been worth it as I bought when single and now my partner has been contributing for 4 years of that 7. And I have a good chunk of equity. It makes sense if you‚Äôre keeping the place for 7-10 years. In my case my mortgage/maintenance fee is lower than if I was renting. But I keep the equity. The value was up around 15% until Covid.

0,"Aug 29, 2020","Probably none with Citi unless you‚Äôve actually been paying those lock fees. If the delay is truly their fault, not consequential to your action or lack thereof, you should not be paying and should go after them to recover those fees or have them credited at closing. You should also demand a rate re-lock at their expense.As far as other options:1) Immediately begin qualification/underwriting with other lenders. Let Citi know this is happening. Yes, you‚Äôre gonna pay some fees but hopefully an extra $2-3k in appraisal and app fees is inconsequential when compared to your refi savings. Even better, hopefully this lights a fire under your LO‚Äôs ass to close the loan.2) Unless you hold significant assets with Citi, why did you go there in the first place? Generally credit unions and non-bank lenders are offering significantly better terms than traditional banks. Again, don‚Äôt know your situation with regard to credit, income, debt, home value, location, etc. but I‚Äôd be hard pressed to believe you‚Äôre getting a good deal with Citi. 5/1 and 7/1 products can be had for less than 3% Rate/APR with closing cost rebates at many CU‚Äôs these days.3) Last thought, is this a conforming loan? If so, Citi may be getting ready to slap the new Fannie/Freddie 0.5% refi fee on you.

0,"Feb 17, 2019","I am raising two kids and have mixed feeling about nyc as a place to raise a family. Pros: - everything close by or delivered. You can find bunch of things for kids right in you neighborhood.- museum, science centers etc can go to different one everyday.- close to Europe and Caribbean :)Cons:- expensive and crowded. Rent, activities etc all will cost  a pretty penny. But that gets offset by higher TC (mostly)- commute. 30 minutes is a very ambitious goal. Will depend where is your office in the city but be prepared to spend much more time or the train or pay good chunk of your tc for rent.- schools mostly suck. It‚Äôs no secret that nyc schools suck (system itself) and that many people move to Long Island or New Jersey once kids reach school age.",5,hfgnntunv,/company/Salesforce/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/NYC-for-Family-w0eKfDo6,Citi
