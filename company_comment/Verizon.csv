0,Feb 28,At VZ the STI and RSUs are based on the band and non negotiable. 20% STI and 10K RSUs for a band 6. Where you can negotiate is the base salary. I would expect an offer between 140-150 which would put you TC just under 180-190k.

I was always amazed at the people who keep working saying they want a voluntary layoff so they can get 35 weeks and they have worked for years while saying that and now they get 60 so they are gone. Great for them but seems to be a waste for VZ. Most folks I know who weren’t ready don’t feel they can are staying to get ready while having a job to leave on their own terms. I’m unsure myself.

0,Apr 1,"Am I having deja vu? I saw you cross post many times. In short, your VM TC seems average, not bad, maybe even good after considering the location. Level wise, it’s not really low for 2 YOE. I would guess your interview feedback is not strong.If it’s the TC your aiming for, and VM’s offer not the best, you can do aggressive negotiation. But seems it’s not the case. I know you want to strike for the highest possible offer, I mean, who doesn’t? But the most effective way is to show a competitive offer, and you don’t have one.I would say unless you get yourself up leveled, 20k more stock at most is what you can get after negotiation, if your interview feedback is strong positive. Not sure about your financial situation, but that doesn’t seems a lot to me, as it’s just a 7k pretax annual income. I suggest you try to negotiate but don’t hope for a big jump on the number though.Instead of focusing on the minor TC difference, I suggest you focus more on whether you like the team, the tech stack and if it would be a good skill growth and career grow. Ask recruiters to set up some meeting for you and teammate if you can’t make a decision. I always do that.If you don’t like the VM TC, the other option is asking more time before giving out the decision and arrange other interviews asap.",2,dqHk83,/company/Verizon-Media/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Please-review-my-Verizon-Media-vs-start-up-offers-How-much-should-I-aim-for-in-negotiation-xakaM0wT,Verizon
