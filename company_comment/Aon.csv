0,Feb 23,"Unless you are already in a strong tech role making $300k-$400k+ it's generally a no brainer to do a top 3 MBA. Worst case you get a network which opens doors through life and meet some people who will be at the top of their game. Best case it helps you meet many other shorter term goals in addition to above.I am guessing you don't fit in the category I mentioned where opportunity costs would be enormous, so go ahead and do the MBA. You really don't have much to lose.",2,woloo,/company/Google/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/International-HBS-student-w-Strategy-experience---attractive-for-PM-role-nO6pZrcC,Aon
1,Feb 23,"Don‚Äôt overthink in life. I once did that while deciding between my grad school.Trust me it doesn‚Äôt help. This is a small decision of your life. And in grand scheme of things the ‚ÄúDots do connect‚Äù.You don‚Äôt do MBA to become a product manager or an Entreprenuer. MBA doesn‚Äôt teach you all that.If you want to be Product Manager, start conceiving ideas yourself and build those. Sketch them out.If you want to be an Entreprenuer, just go and start a business. You learn business by actually building one and doing it and not in some MBA books.If you want to speed up on corporate ladder and get a management track role in company then MBA helps. It doesn‚Äôt basically teach you any new skills. But will just put you on a fast corporate ladder.If you want to build a network and have a lifelong brand of Harvard on ur profile, join HBS.",1,SV_Sucks,/company/Facebook/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/International-HBS-student-w-Strategy-experience---attractive-for-PM-role-nO6pZrcC,Aon
