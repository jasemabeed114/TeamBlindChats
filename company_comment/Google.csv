The most tech question I got asked in my last tech interview redo sounded pretty basic on how to deploy system already designed to a number of DCs. I guess I was expecting more technical discussions like breakdown of k8 architecture or how to design or improve scalable distributed systems. Most of the questions asked where behavioral. How is a candidate tech judgement assessed by behavioral questions.

4,4d,"From my perception the way I separated DS and MLE isDS - more theory. Can be research roles. Working on high level model design and general are first in line to make decisions on metrics, model selection, etc. Normally work in jupyter notebooks and are less technical. Typically are the ones coordinating the most with clients and stake holders to explain the model.MLE - builds and trains models but more focused on the technical architecture. Makes feature changes and enhancements to the repo and coordinates deployments and system design. Varying amounts of infra work. Specific theory/DS work varies depending on how many projects team owns and number of DS on team.I have no idea where a ""Data analyst"" or ""Product Analyst"" fits into this.This is from my non-FAANG experience primarily. I have an MLE offer from Google and my role is going to be model building and infra. I don't think there are any DS or DA on this model so all the model tuning falls to MLE.I don't think any MLE are creating any algos or doing research. MLE is like masters/PhD preferred and DS is like masters required PhD preferred IMO interviewing at top companies. Although despite asking this same question 100 times in interviews to HMs, MLE, DS, and on blind, I still can't narrow down an answer. I feel like so many different people have different ideas of what these roles do and it varies so much company to company and team to team. I'm really curious to see what it's like when I actually start in FAANG and can experience it first hand.",1,FactsetBad,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Google-L5-Data-Analyst-TC-X07ubHEf,Google

If you don't have a PhD they don't give you a research engineer title, but you can be an MLE and do the same tasks. Source: I have an MLE offer from Google and I'm an MLE at Apple, both roles let me publish new ML work (at NeurIPS, CVPR) while I do applied research daily geared towards a product.

6,Yesterday,"As someone who did a PhD, and am also in tech, maybe I can share my views. Tldr is if you dream of retiring early, don't do a PhD. But if you care about life experiences, do it.The cost is huge, you'll probably lose 2.5M+ in salary. Adjusting for taxes and expenses, your savings 5 years down the line could differ by up to 1M. And that's a big dent if you're a FIRE sort of person. You will also earn less after PhD than staying at Google for those 5 years, till at least you're 40. At which point long term PhD might change that. Not because the title matters, but because it may teach you how to truly plan at a 5 year scale. But it's all suspect. Don't do PhD for financial reasons.On the other hand, you do have only one life to live. And today if I could trade 1M for 5 years doing another PhD I would take it in a heartbeat. It's a unique experience, and you'll make some lifelong friends and learn things that may not be practical but will be exciting. You'll have more time to think things up and then pursue them. You'll have the smartest people to bounce your ideas with and there isn't going to be a 30 minute meeting limit.So yeah, live a little.

HCs job is to make sure that a consistent bar is followed across G and it's not left in the interviewers hand only. Cloud is trying to hire fast at the expense of taking some false +ves.

0,Apr 22,"My first round which was a phone screen was from an interviewer from London (3PM IST). It was a simple question on Stacks.I finished my loop of 3 on site interviews today, all of them were scheduled in the night, 11PM and all of the interviewers were from US. Surprisingly, all of them also worked at Microsoft at some point of time, probably because I gave C# as my preferred language.I screwed my 2nd on site, it was a question on topological sort but it also involved parallelism. The question seemed weird as it had some extra methods related to callbacks which I could never wrap my head around. I screwed up royally, I got the idea of topo sort but the implementation went nowhere. Plus I felt the question was confusing when you add Callback methods.The first on site was about finding a longest path in a graph, I used DFS. I got the implementation right but I missed an edge case.The third on site (few hours back) was a question on trees. I got the idea & the implementation right but I felt the interviewer was giving me hints even when I didn‚Äôt want them. It felt like a guided interview where the interviewer was critiquing every line as I was writing it and asking me if this is correct or not and if it wasn‚Äôt he was dropping hints. The interviewer was super nice though.All of my onsite interviewers were based out of US. Feels weird saying it but all of them were non-Indians too. There seems to be this puzzling trend of Indians criticising other Indian Googlers as the latter only ask really tough CP questions. Didn‚Äôt happen with me. All of my interviewers were super nice. Maybe the 2nd onsite interview could have been better, the interviewer added a lot of implementation details about parallelism and callbacks which threw me off completely and here I was eager to write the simple topological sort code. ~4 YOE.",7,NadelaSoft,/company/Microsoft/,Eng,/post/Google-India-screening-round-m2Z2JavN,Google

If you can find a better job, take it. 1 week into a new place and get something better? Take it. For roles less than 3 months, just leave it off your resume. The hard thing is defining ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. - How can you determine ‚Äúbetter‚Äù? Depends on you - many factors to weigh. Money, title, company, growth opportunities, quality of coworkers, etc. Write down the pros/cons of your current role on whatever you think is important. Then revisit that document in a week. Then revisit again in a month. Then 3 months‚Ä¶ etc. If you notice things staying the same as far as pro/con then you can rely on those as criteria for deciding whether it‚Äôs time to stay/go. If you have more pros over time and are happy - great! If more cons, start looking. - Think of where you want to be in 2-3 years, is your current role leading you there?- Later in your career, if you want a leadership role (eng. management, principal eng.), you‚Äôll need proof you led the creation of something successful - a team, a product, a source of revenue, etc. It takes time to build something good, so tenure will be longer.This is what I‚Äôve heard and found helpful so far.

6,2d,"Yeah of course! Fwiw, my thought process for recursion is:can this problem be intuitively modeled after a tree or a graph?Aside from the obvious tree or graph problem, the answer is usually yes for brute force and DP problems.So basically what you need to do, is start with tree and graph problems. Make sure you‚Äôve got those down so good you can recognize all of the simple instances of that problemFrom there, move into some Brute force and DP problems. These require the same pieces of knowledge as the above problems, you just have to bridge the gap in understanding and apply the same to these new problemsFrom there you‚Äôre basically good.
