3,"Oct 25, 2018","Base is always greater in trading firms than in tech companies, even for sde roles. But tech companies have stock, while this type of ‚Äúunpredictable compensation‚Äù is annual bonus in those trading firms. The value of the annual bonus in trading firms will be similar to the sum of vested stock plus performance bonus in tech firms. The tricky part is that the annual bonus can vary a lot - increase if firm is making good profit and decrease if firm is not making enough. If the firm is doing extremely well, the annual bonus can possibly be even higher than your base salary, but it is rare for sde roles.I have an offer from a trading firm and some of my friends are working in that industry. Based on what I have observed, for 2sigma or Jane street or other trading firms, they basically pay the same as tech companies in TC; but Citadel is sort of the only exceptional one - besides having huge TC, it pays a super large amount of base salary that can go beyond a normal sde‚Äôs imagination, so it beats all other companies and becomes ""tier -1"".Sde is inferior to quant in those firms, so quant will always get the best perk.

I‚Äôve tried my best to answer all of them in a couple of sentences, but if you have more follow up questions feel free to dm me.1. Engineers are treated pretty well. There‚Äôs no front/back office divide afaict. I think we try pretty hard to align everybody‚Äôs incentives and specifically avoid creating pay gaps between different dev groups that are nominally at different distances from ‚Äúwhat makes the money‚Äù but really are just equally valuable. I don‚Äôt have a great picture of traders‚Äô comp, but honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the average dev and average trader make the same.2. The skills I‚Äôve learned definitely feel transferrable. Trading as a business domain doesn‚Äôt feel that different from something else selling ads online. Sure, depending on the team you might end up learning some finance-y stuff that‚Äôs not generally applicable elsewhere, but the fundamentals of software engineering are the same regardless of where you go.3. JS has a reputation for being very selective, which I believe means it‚Äôs a good thing to have JS on your resume.4. Most devs at JS work *pretty reasonable* hours. I average 45 hours a week, and I don‚Äôt feel weird about it.5.

There are firms that value devops highly, ours is one of them.The work is generally about monitoring, first-in-line firefighting, certain types of system improvements (usually through well-established means) and various day to day operational work that are automated as much as possible.The valuable traits are the ability to make level-headed decisions quickly, the ability to navigate complexity, and a strong work ethic. There's not much need to be very creative on the job, but there's still value in being smart. The ""hard"" skills you develop would be better for syseng rather than SWE, but devops is not syseng and can be involved in many business-level decision making because they're more involved in the specific business domain needs.

Thus you are incentived to help out where you can overall.Culture is usually not too different between swe and quant/traders at the same firm. But varies between firms. Usually the biggest difference is how collaborative or competitive they are. Some will cut bottom 10% performers every year. Truth is they're all significantly different.Comp is a huge black box but for some perspective I know a quant at JS who made 360k (not counting signon) his first year out of college, and another at 5r who pulled about 1.4m in one of his good years (he was around 28).

4,"Dec 27, 2018","I think at TS there is strong interest in having people grow as ICs. I think growth on the manager side is more driven by growth of the company and needs. I think at this point there are more then enough senior managers, but not enough first line managers or senior ICs so there are growth opportunities there. I think people don‚Äôt really know what makes someone ready for the next level on the IC track through, which does make it hard to grow there. On the manager track it‚Äôs largely team size, but the problem is this depends on external factors outside of your control. In the end, one of the things I‚Äôve realized is every large company has a broken system for advancement and it‚Äôs better to focus on making yourself more skilled if you want to advance your career, and also be ready to make a move (possibly internally but maybe externally) to advance your career. A place like Two Sigma or FAANG will be good for skill growth up to the tech lead manager level, beyond that you‚Äôll probably need to change employers to keep advancing. Possible another FAANG or TS will work, but they tend to down-level senior people unless you‚Äôre famous, so you may need to look much broader.I get the impression Citadel is better in this regard and more of a meritocracy, but it‚Äôs also a more volatile environment which means luck is probably a bigger factor there.",5,abcdcba987,/company/Two-Sigma/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Do-places-like-Jane-Street-Two-Sigma-HRT-have-IC-and-management-tracks-like-FAANG-GKcmmJkj,Jane-Street

I still get to make the design decisions and think about how every piece of code is going to fit togetherI am working in the low latency software team. I have to read assembly code or do micro benchmarking. But, this is not the biggest part of my job. I would say 5-10%. There are a lot of other engineers working on products that are not latency critical. I would say 20% of our SW dudes work in my teamThere are more quantitative engineers, often referred as quants. They don‚Äôt do any low latency stuff. There are also engineers working on UI or the data pipeline. Data engineers are more focused on scalability. We have a lot of data to analyze in financeThe latency competition is not as critical as it used to be in SW. If the latency competition is very high, then most of the participants in the latency game already moved to FPGA. If the latency competition is not high, it probably means it is not worth the money to optimize the latency for that particular marketIn short, you will do low latency stuff depending of your team. Even if you are in the right team, the impact of software low latency is not as high as it used to be because of FPGA.

Do take note that the tax free allowance of 12.5k is reduced by 1 pound every 2 pounds earned over 100k. That causes a marginal tax rate of 60% on every pound earned over 100k, because you‚Äôre suddenly taking pounds that we‚Äôre never taxed and taxing them, and then also taking the new pound earned and taxing that. This stops at 125k when you no longer have any tax free allowance.Add the Employers NI for RSUs and your RSUs can be taxed up to 67%. Read the article, it breaks it down for you.Contributing to a pension means that that money isn‚Äôt taxed and your taxable income drops by that much. So if you‚Äôre currently at 123k, contribute 23k to pension if you can so your taxable income is 100k. That will save you from a high marginal rate of taxation.Do up an excel sheet if you must.

I‚Äôm only talking about criterias that make me an as individual contributor on the technology side feel better all around (on top of pay of course but honestly I don‚Äôt need mind blowing numbers to be happy).Out of the listed firms that I‚Äôve interviewed with I‚Äôve felt the best about HRT culture wise. Though as far as I can tell Radix is supposed to be super good.  If I were to rank the firms I wouldn‚Äôt rank them by pay because I can‚Äôt say I know what these firms really pay across the board after several yoe in.  I will say I‚Äôve read from a lot of places that Jump‚Äôs pay band is really wide.,4,Kristaps11,/company/Susquehanna/,Eng,/post/A-Complete-List-of-Top-High-Frequency-Trading-Firms-and-the-Salary-Info-jCPzKdwF,Jane-Street

Also there are some other things to note. For example, optiver is a direct akuna competitor. They pay you base salary for your 3 month non compete after leaving. Akuna goes not.My akuna recruiter would roughly say things like akuna can generally match and slightly beat top tech like goog FB pay.

3,Apr 8,"I've done a few of these recently. Many of them are generally similar to a FAANG-style interview. Some of them have slightly heavier algorithms (e.g. using O(log n) heap updates, which doesn't come by default in Python priority queue, or using tries). Some of them are fairly involved multi-part questions - first a Leetcode-type question, then ""What if you have this much memory? What if you need to support X operation? What if you can preprocess and then answer queries online?"" - although even my Google interviews had a few of those this time as well. Some companies have a heavier focus on C++ (for example, a HackerRank test that must be done in C++). Jane Street specifically asks for clean code vs. efficient code - don't implement something really complicated to save some small constant factor, and if you see such a tradeoff, tell them about it and what choice you're making.Google, for example, has you code on a Google Doc (???) and doesn't run the code.

0,"Dec 29, 2019","(Background: I used to work at Citadel and now work at another top quant firm).As for TC growth -- yes, the top quant shops can definitely pay what you're looking for and if you're really good, the TC can grow much higher. However, I suspect in your case you might have to take a pay cut at least for the first year or two. You are switching to a new area with no track record and no domain expertise -- those companies might be willing to take a chance on you but since you're looking for 700k+ then I suspect they might not be willing to pay top dollar until you first prove you can deliver.Part of it is seeing if your skills can transfer (a good ""applied researcher"" on computer vision is not necessarily going to be good at finding trading signals) but also there are a few cultural differences between FANG and hedge funds and I've seen a huge number of tech people flame out due to cultural mismatch that they weren't willing to adjust to.So yes, it's definitely possible and if things work out you'll be able to get to the comp you're looking for; so I recommend interviewing if you're interested just to see what happens. But I suspect the offer's bonus may be a ""target"" rather than a ""guarantee"" and there's a lot that can go wrong. I suspect you might decide it's not worth the risk.

4,Feb 2,"Note that this isn't a ""prestige"" ranking because the question tells us what % of the voters would be willing to work at a place, not whether it's suitable for those who chose to already work there. Less being drunk on kool-aid, but relatively less informed participants.Personally, I feel that it's better to use company ratings across the five questions (career growth, work - life balance, compensation / benefits, company culture, management) because those offer a more accurate and detailed breakdown than the larger external pool (albeit bigger samples tend to have lower standard error), although the numbers are positively correlated.As more people upvote or downvote, the proportions I shared can change over time, and I purposely excluded Citadel and Robinhood from mention due to recent events.The statistics obviously aren't perfect, due to different sub-populations of people checking each page and response rate bias. Hope it provides some insight into the less commonly mentioned names and deflates the popularity factor (leaning too heavily toward brand names in neglect of high-quality smaller companies).A short list of those companies I checked with sample sizes too small to be shown:Bank of AmericaBoxCredit SuisseD.E. ShawDRWGlassdoorIndeedJPMorgan ChaseLockheed MartinSamsungSAPSusquehanna International GroupTableauVerizonYelpZillowIt was harder to locate the reviews page for quant hedge funds and prop shops, but I managed to navigate to them by finding tagged posts and clicking the company links. Based on elementary number-theoretic considerations, HRT should have at least 14 votes, which is more than the number of full reviews, yet admittedly not a lot (it could be much more, I'm not certain).If I have more time later, I'll come back and create separate posts for the more specific rating categories.
