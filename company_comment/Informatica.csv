1,"May 15, 2020","I would ask more of what is the advantage of Git. In order to effectively use Git in an org, what‚Äôs the first thing you do?  Setup a centralizer like GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.Perforce‚Äôs tooling is miles ahead of git imo. Beyond that, Perforce has a level of permanence that git doesn‚Äôt. One of the common themes in this thread is ‚Äúwell I have a full copy, so that‚Äôs safer‚Äù - but perforce is much more robust and has more info than git would keep anyway.Git promotes a broken model, in my opinion. It promotes working in isolation, and you are dependent on process to ensure code is merged and made visible frequently. It‚Äôs counter to the culture of CI and general collaboration you want in an enterprise.It‚Äôs great for open source. Beyond that, though, I‚Äôm not sure the following is warranted. It‚Äôs a fine tool, but I‚Äôm entirely unconvinced the system is really setup to foster the collaboration and permanence a big org really wants.",2,n64gtfo,/company/GE/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/I-should-not-tell-you-this-but-yxb0ZCLw,Informatica

That‚Äôs not the norm and more of an exception, even in bay area.Is your 14 years of experience in some specialized field like ML, DL, Computer vision? Even if not specialized, do you have tons of experience in distributed systems? Because most of the web companies that do tend to pay those high salaries works a lot on distributed systems.At 14 years, just doing LC wont be enough. You ll be grilled on system design, and expected to know how to design large scale distributed systems. Reading about things is a good start, but that wont replace real experience.
