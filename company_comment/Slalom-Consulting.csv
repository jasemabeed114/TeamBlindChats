0,"Jan 13, 2020","It is, but you have to understand that the promise of a 40‚Äìhour work week and all the ensuing WLB perks, those are all promised to the Consultants.  As soon as you start making your way up the totem pole, you‚Äôll have to put in the extra hours just as you would anywhere else.I am currently at this ‚Äúconsultant‚Äú level and negotiated well upon arriving. So I‚Äôm not feeling any of the gripes coming from folks who aren‚Äôt liking their annual increases. I have also been told that some people have stayed at this consultant level for many years, they really liked it, didn‚Äôt want to manage people, and therefore weren‚Äôt pressured into other roles. While at the same time they were able to earn considerably more over time money in the same role.I love the no-travel option. The regional model definitely works. The only problem is the kinds of jobs you‚Äôre forced to take sometimes resemble more of a staff augmentation situation than true full-scale  consulting projects.The people in general are great. There‚Äôs some variability in each location in terms of the kind of culture. Some are very friendly and feel like a family, where as others are a bit more typical corporate.",3,AlfredoBro,/company/Slalom-Consulting/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Slalom-Consulting-2aZLGX4V,Slalom-Consulting

2,"Mar 18, 2020","10/10 would recommend Slalom. They won't share the roles, because they're not a fan of pigeonholing you + would rather have you see what you like based on the technical interviews.They have  robust training/onboarding and they are against going after huge projects because they know their employees won't be treated right... Staff augmentation sucks and if you've worked at Accenture, you know that you'll be treated as another number. They don't play ppl like that at slalom.Overall, an honest company that prioritizes their ppl.",1,ilovemayo,/company/FiscalNote/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Interview-with-Slalom-EcmOrxcD,Slalom-Consulting

4,"Jul 12, 2019","The Cat Digital team? Before the onsite it was a tech phone screen, phone coding screen, 2 level cache design project. The onsite was a 1on1 design interview for about 30-45min, then whiteboard coding with 2 people, then 2 other people came in and finished the different implementation of the last problem and asked me a few questions about my design choices on the project. After that they just did the STAR interview which they straight up BS lmao. I guess its just a formality for them.Design question was basically revolved around scheduling simultaneous service calls across multiple nodes and how the backend would be designed.The coding question was delete an entire file system but can't delete if there is subfiles/folders. Solved it recursively then they had me to do iteratively as well to avoid the risk of stack overflowing.I'm pretty sure the team I was interviewing with was all backend tho",0,dagoat,/company/Motorola-Mobility/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Chicago-SWE-offers-CpPN54Au,Slalom-Consulting

If you are truly ‚Äòback office‚Äô you will be a second class citizen in the consulting world.Also, MOVE.

8,"Jul 11, 2019","I'd vote CAT. Few reasons - having worked in cube farms, lowered wall cube farms, and totally open concept, open concept is a load of shit and a total drag on productivity. It feels sexy at first but you can't get anything done bec of the noise and people walking around.Depending on what you want to do with your career, you could steer the CAT role in a few diff directions too:  big data for IoT, data science analytics (imo this is the direction tech is headed for the next 10-15 years), or pure infra engineering which is also lucrative and has job stability. On Slalom using all three aws azure and gcp, my personal experience is that aws gives you a lot to work with in terms of which part of the stack you want to develop, third party apps to integrate, etc. Exeprience with the built-in tools is also an advantage outside of the aws environment. Azure is a close second but they still have work to do with simplifying the environment. The management console on aws is also better, not sure if you'll be managing any workloads though. Personal preference for me is also going with the shorter commute. They say that every extra 20 mins of commuting feels like a 10% pay cut (I don't remember the numbers exactly though).401k match at Slalom is not so good imo (1 yr wait period specifically).Arguments against what I'm saying though -You are still very young in your career and can't go wrong with picking one over the other. Working in a younger company means you may have more flexibility in changing projects/tasks, while that's harder in old school companies where most people's project focus is very narrow. Getting experience on all three major could platforms is also a marketable skill.Hackathons, good break room, young crowd, etc can and do affect morale and can make a difference in how you feel about your job day to day.If you pick CAT try to renege gracefully and keep in touch with 1-2 ppl from Slalom.",1,Spin_Move,/company/LinkedIn/,Ops,/post/Chicago-SWE-offers-CpPN54Au,Slalom-Consulting
