Reasons: a)they were getting paid low than market rate or HR low balled them and they fell for it. b) Culture is horrible. Nepotism runs in this company. A director was reported of his bad moral ethics to HR. Many complaints were raised against him but HR did not take any action against him. Rather they fired employees who reported it or let them go with severance package. Heard this Director was promoted to a Sr. Director recently. All this happened because he is a very close friend of VP. c) No growth for honest and hardworking people. I am glad I left this company earlier.

CEO himself is great individual and leader, he holds high standards and being very conscious about the mistakes he made. I've been in the company several years and I've seen many great things happening. I suggest you search Mohit’s interview in podcasts to know better of his vision and journey.Long term value wise, the company still have a lot of potential, we’ve proved to the market that massive data fragmentation is an issue and we are able to resolve it. You won't see many other company at this age able to attain big name customers like Amex with massive deployments. Now we are at second stage, which is continue to disrupt backup/archive space, expand to cloud, bring compute and application to the data and build eco system (marketplace) around data. When that matured you are looking at 10B+ company.If you join now you still benefit from 1B evaluation from last round, and internally we know we have being doing great, if we start a new round tomorrow it would be at least 2-3B of evaluation. Long-term you are looking 10x of return.Sometimes to join a startup you just need to buy into the vision and know the cake is big.We don't have any near term goal of IPO or, acquisition. As an old timer maybe my only concern is that Mohit himself may not have a lot of motivation of bringing company IPO soon, as he already achieved his financial freedom long time ago from Nutanix, if not Google. But he does have all the motivation to build a great company, not just product, a company.My estimate is that we will probably be IPO in 2-4 years, depends on the market condition at that time.",9,xgdp,/company/Cohesity/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Cohesity-culture-1WvVGi7B,Cohesity

In general teams are helpful and focused, although again, the mid-level management is very insecure. That Apurv guy from Blr - he may be brilliant but he is extremely arrogant. That culture is sometimes disturbing. The problem is that many newer folks are nowhere comparable but still try to emulate that arrogance.Go in for a fast paced year or eighteen months, learn stuff, then go elsewhere.

Most of the engineers are motivated and smart.I agree with some of the comments about arrogance. To add to that there are people who are close to Mohit and can tweak the system the way they want. This kind of culture is been seen at other startups as well - nothing new. Look at it from other angle - Cohesity has achieved quite a bit in the past couple of years. They have doubled the evaluation of the company in 1-1.5 years - which is amazing. Even when the market wasn't doing good the company has seen the strongest qtr in its history.Unlike some other startups there are too many distractions for engineering. One of the biggest one is that support wants to pull engineering in all most of the customer calls without debugging any issue. Most of the support that is hired at Cohesity in past 2 years is sub-par which puts a lot of pressure on engineering. Support doesn't add much value here. They are more like proxies. They cant solve technical problems, handle customer pressure nor can they set any expectations with customers - technically challenged. Upper management in support is technically sound but when it comes to strategy they don't know how to grow it. Support does not put much effort in debugging or even understanding what the use case is on escalations.

7,"Nov 2, 2020","Cohesity now has a SaaS solution as well and the expectation is that Cohesity would be able to port the adapters more easily compared to building them from scratch.Another aspect is that, its not clear Clumio's approach of no on-prem cache would take off. Data warehousing and backups are common in the sense, you can stream the daily updates to the cloud. But that is where the comparison ends. Unlike data warehouse like snowflake where you can run query in the cloud, with backup, when disaster strikes, you want to restore large amount of data fast. This is the reason all the other SaaS vendors - Cohesity, Comvault, Druva support an optional cache. Clumio is building one as well - which is the hard part.On valuation, you want the valuation to track revenue from C onwards where valuation is based on revenue. If it is very high compared to the revenue, you as an employee are missing out on the stock price growth. Because eventually the valuation will catch up and what that means for you is that the stock price will not grow as much.",4,Qpna23,/company/Cohesity/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Clumio-pXjGkFd7,Cohesity

10,"Dec 18, 2020","From personal and other friends' experiences :-In Veritas, most of the teams (primarily in NetBackUp) are really chilled out, but in some teams, there's high attrition of senior developers (both resginations and layoffs). But overall, the culture is really awesome, although the pay is a bit less there.Druva is almost becoming the 2nd Veritas, since most of the people who leave Veritas, end up joining Druva.Fidelity Investments in Bangalore is a really fun place to work for, people are really friendly there.Oracle is absolutely BS, with married couples in the same team and highly toxic work environments.

5,Jan 25,You can complain to labor commisioner. My friend did that with cognizant whrn a similar thing happened to him. He had the best rating and was still asked to go. He demanded 2 months notice which they refused to give bim. So he went the labour route and held them from firing him for alsmost 4 months while he got a job and he quit.,0,UBkC63,/company/Verizon/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/In-a-delicate-situation-Need-help-with-referrals-for-PM-roles-rfYUBeXd,Cohesity

As someone that did reasonably well as a student (including PhD), working on the right area at the right time is way more determinant than being smart.
