3,May 11,"1) You enter Focus, sometimes with but oftentimes without you even knowing.  This can last a few months. During this time, you are not allowed to transfer internally without VP approval.  Focus is meant to be a formal coaching process to get you to the bar.2) At the end of the Focus period, your manager has to make a decision: did you improve during Focus to somebody that meets the bar for your level?  If yes, you‚Äôre back to normal standing with a healthy dose of stigma associated with you. If no, you enter Pivot (PIP).3) In Pivot, your manager creates a plan with detailed success criteria and milestones.  This plan normally covers about 30-45 days of work and the plan is vetted by your HRBP.4) This plan gets submitted into a system and HR will author the final Pivot document which contains all of the details. This document gets presented to the person in a 1 on 1, sometimes with HR attending.5) This document describes why the person is in Pivot, as well as the Plan to get someone out of Pivot.  They‚Äôre given two options and five days to decide.  If they decide to leave the company now, they will be given severance commensurate to tenure. If they decide to take on the Plan, they forfeit their large severance package in an attempt to keep their job.6) If you don‚Äôt take severance, you do the Plan and can either succeed or fail.

9,Apr 25,"At the top level, for unplanned leave (I.e., not something like surgery that has been scheduled well ahead of time), you open an FMLA case through your employer.You then have about three weeks to have scheduled an appointment with medical provider for diagnosis and to have submitted a medical health form from your provider that lists the diagnostics and that your treatment plan includes not working.  (The leave will be denied if it is not supported by a licensed medical provider).There are a few approaches however, that are context based.If you are facing risk of self-harm or immediate consequences, seek urgent care immediately! And just file for FMLA to pause and protect your job while you are working with medical provider... and the diagnostics and paperwork will catch up over the 21 days before it has to be submitted.But most of us who take mental health leave are facing ongoing issue of depression, anxiety, ADHD, autism, past trauma, etc. that is not at an ‚Äúurgent, should not wait‚Äù level.If you are not facing need for urgent care, and there is some doubt or concern whether a psychiatrist or psychologist will (a) provide a diagnosis and (b) state that you are under their care and that you should stop working for a period of time... then you may want to first begin seeing your Primary Care Provider and also begin working with a Psych*. From there, you will know that they will support your leave; and you can more confidently file for FMLA with your employer.  Note: it can still be unscheduled leave (not needing 30 day notice); just less stress knowing you have a provider and they will fill out the forms in a timely manner.* Prioritize finding someone who is right for you for your long term care; but also someone who will support your leave if possible. Often, people do not click with the first Psych they meet with (equally true for therapist as well).Also, many companies provide for short medical or personal leave option ‚Äî maybe 2 to 4 or 6 weeks duration.  It is not job protecting (meaning, your company has discretion on whether to approve it). But, this may also be an option.  A PCP can usually provide medical leave form for this shorter duration leave, but will defer to a Psych specialist for longer FMLA and/or short term disability leave claim.",3,seaaadd,/company/Amazon/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Amazon-PIP-and-FMLA-Rh33ES1i,Amazon

10,Mar 17,"First, don‚Äôt focus on vesting schedule too much. Amazon does this weird-as-shit comp strategy where your first 2 years you get signing bonuses (paid monthly) until your RSUs kick in. If you actually model it out, Y1-2 are ‚Äúhigher‚Äù than Y3-4 because they factor in expected stock growth.Second, you manage yourself how you feel, but my impression of Amazon is I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. I hear good things about MSFT WLB, just understand you‚Äôre probably giving that up entirely, and not necessarily in favor of career growth.Finally, I‚Äôll show you how my L5 offer looked, initial and negotiated. Note, this was a non-Bay location with same comp bands as Seattle.Initial: ~$245k TC with $155k base and signing bonus of $83k (y1) and $61k (y2). RSUs were 77 shares and however that broke down in 5/15/40/40 filled the gaps.I wasn‚Äôt satisfied because A) compensation would drop significantly over time if stock price didn‚Äôt go up substantially (~18%) and B) I was coming from FB and this was a huge TC drop.I pushed back, and I modeled TC over time and sent my recruiter spreadsheets and analysis. I mentioned how I disliked that it required 18% stock growth to break even at Y3, but even with 0 stock growth at FB my comp in the same time would be 9% higher than present due to refreshers.2 days later I got an updated offer.TC: $245k to $290k (above band for L5 in this location)Base: $155k to $155k üôÑ (weird salary logic here)Sign-on: y1 $83k to $123k, y2 $61k to $90kRSUs: 77 to 106tl;dr if you don‚Äôt like your offer, push back and make a case for why you deserve(?) more.",1,rustacean,/company/Amazon/,Eng,/post/Amazon-L5-offer-RfyDoP0Q,Amazon

Or did your final offer end up being higher than what you were making at FB?The main problem with MSFT is that next year my compensation would effectively drop by 70k (if the stock price doesn't move) or a lot more.

At Amazon, you will be a manager, but L5 SDM as an external hire is not a good long term role - you need to hustle to get to L6 as soon as possible and you need strong support from your manager, since nobody will respect an L5 SDM, particularly one who has no tenure at Amazon. Career progress-wise, if you want to work at a great company and relax a bit, sure, go to Google. If you want to hustle your ass off and get farther, faster, and have a LOT of confidence in your hiring manager, then go to Amazon.",2,JSnowflake,/company/Amazon/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Google-L4-vs-Amazon-L5-kZXqYPi5,Amazon

Try First Tech Federal Credit Union, they provide great benefits to MSFT employees so maybe they would provide perks to Amazon folks as well because I know that they work with all Tech companies.I called Chase as well but they told me that I need to provide a year's worth of banking statements to build up credit so not going with that route.The banks that MSFT relocation package suggested were Wells Fargo and Guaranteed Rate Affinity but looking to go with First Tech as a number of my colleagues recommended it.20% is not the minimum for downpayment at least with First Tech. They have an option where you could do 5% down, 15% at a higher interest rate and 80% normal rate. You could also do 10% down, 10% at a higher interest rate and 80% normal rate. This is good because you don't have to pay mortgage insurance and can quickly pay off the section that's at higher interest rate when your stocks vest or you get a lump sum.First Tech also provided me with some cash for closing and a great credit score even though I had zero credit history in the US so do check them out. I can connect you with the Loan Officer who I'm working with if that helps.You will need to get preapproval so the officer can guide you through that but more importantly you will need to get SSN which is a very painful process at the moment as it's appointment only and you are at their mercy of them providing you with an appointment (waitlist and what not).
