2,May 13,"He said most not all. Why is that misogynistic. Same can be said for guys too. Most people are incompetent or unnecessary in their jobs and can be replaced easily. Most guys are perverted or creepy. We say not all men or we just chuck it and move on because it doesn't reflect us. We don't go about canceling every woman and hurt her job prospects for it. He ain't right but he ain't wrong either. I've seen a lot of women who don't interview well, can't code, or do any work in general. It's clear they got hired just because they are women and more often than not they create unnecessary confusion in meetings and someone else has to work late to pick up their slack. There are some hardworking women who go beyond lengths not to prove they are equal to men but to stand out from the rest of the women. They know they can perform as well or even outperform men. They don't want to be seen as other women who aren't effective in their workplace. I hate to say it but the statement whoever this dude made isn't that harsh or bad. Everyone is soft, weak and naive as they start out, especially if they are H1b slaves waiting for GC. They don't make waves or piss off anyone.

I also ask some technical questions to baseline fundamentals, but those are not as important as to how you prepared for the interview, and how you think and react to unplanned questions.

At Amazon PE bar is extremely high and you do not PIP at that level. If things do not work out you are mature enough to take hints and move on.

I‚Äôm sorry you experienced what you did and that so many people here are giving you crap for it.  The truth of the matter is that you should not have had to experience any of what you have at Apple or any workplace.  Silicon Valley plays like they want women in the workforce, but 10 years of my life spent in Silicon Valley showed me that they really only want you there to have something pretty to look at or screw.  If you want to be successful in that environment, you have to play the boys‚Äô game of pretending not to be offended by anything you see or hear.HR will not help you.  I know this from experience that HR only cares about covering the company‚Äôs ass and they will find any way to make the complaint go away by managing you out and saying it was because of your poor performance regardless if you performed perfectly.So, you have a decision to make.  Is this company worth the shit you will have to wade through?  Probably not.  If you think it is, then unfortunately you have to play their game to get ahead and maybe if you get far enough up, you can institute some culture change.  The other thing you can do is sue Apple.
