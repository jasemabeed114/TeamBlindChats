0,"Feb 10, 2020","Pre: lived in London for 4 months (going for another later this year); have been living in Stockholm for 6 months; and lived in 4 different countries till now (including several cities in France)To put it short here are my opinions:Live in London is way more alive and vibrant, more crowded and more social.Stockholm is way more quite and family friendly, with way less pollution and traffic jams. The most crowded time in Stockholm is less crowded then Piccadilly Circus at 3am.Taxes are higher in Sweden then UK.Considering the complex renting swedish system (1st hand controlled by state and local municipalities) it's hard to day about how much you'd be paying for accommodation. In any case it would be cheaper then in London.In Stockholm food is healthier, but a little more expensive then in London. Public transportation or biking is your way to go in both cities, but Stockholm's one is cheaper (~90‚Ç¨) compared to London's (>~150‚Ç¨).Finally, London is a lot like center Paris (kinda Ch√¢telet les Hales during peak hours) and Stockholm like a raining gloomy Versailles (city, not palace).P.S. If you have any other, more specific, questions, please feel free to ask.",16,gangalic,nan,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/2-offers-Facebook-v-Spotify---London-v-Stockholm-YE185Lfs,Spotify
