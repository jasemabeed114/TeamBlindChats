2,"Dec 4, 2020","Yep. Internship pay isn’t going to matter regardless. Its fulltime pay + work culture (work life balance, energy of the people) + strength of the engineering team + prestige.For example, Google software engineer interns who are virtual only make $43/hr (without the housing stipend). If they are in person, swe interns at google get a 9k bonus. Which is about $61/hr. Software engineer interns at Capital One make ~57/hr + 6k stipend makes ~70/hr.Would you choose Google or Capital One if you got both offers.  Very likely Google because fulltime new grad offers at google pay $175k TC and capital one pays at max (in San Francisco) 125-130k TC.So think about that. Go on levels.fyi to see the salaries.

Think about how we commonly say ‘can I have a Kleenex’ instead of ‘facial tissue’ or ‘I’m gonna Xerox this’ instead of ‘photocopy’.

6,"Jul 29, 2018","Okay so you actually have roughly 50 different credit scores.There are three major credit bureaus, TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. They each hold slightly different info about you.One of the major differences between the data hold in each credit bureau is the number of inquiries. Banks typically only do an inquiry against one credit bureau, not all three.Some accounts and some collections may show up on only one or two credit bureaus.Some credit bureaus may take longer than others to update with your latest balances.So that’s why the data is different.Then to analyse the data and get a score,There are two main groups of models used. FICO, and VantangeScore. These are owned by different companies. FICO has several different versions used, and within each version, different industry specific scores (general, mortgage, car loan, and credit card)FICO 8 is the most important one usually.FICO 2 is used for mortgages (despite being very old) (median Fico 2 score across all three credit bureaus is used)FICO 3 auto is sometimes used for car loans.VantageScore is rarely used for lending. It is sometimes (soft) pulled each month by some banks to decide if they want to give you a credit limit increase, or sometimes (lending club used to do this I believe) pulled first, before using FICO, when applying for credit.If I understand correctly, this is because FICO costs more to use than VantageScore.

1,"Oct 20, 2020","Happy to explain. VTSAX is a collection of stocks, exactly right. The letters are a symbol for Vanguard Total Stock Fund Admiral Shares.This is a collection of stocks called an index fund. An index fund is a pooled investment in the entire stock market index. Shares are bought in proportion to each company's total stock value as a percentage of the entire stock market's value. So if you bought $100 of this index fund, and Company A's total value was 2% of the entire market, $2 of your $100 investment in the fund would represent an investment in Company A.You can see how this will let you own a piece of every company, no matter how much or how little you have to invest. In return for this, you have to pay the fund owner a small percentage of your investment. Vanguard has some of the lowest percentage rates around. These charged rates are the biggest contributor toward your overall investment performance over a long period of time: the lower the rate, the better for you.Index funds are very attractive because they offer diversification. Study after study has shown that diversification of investments is the best way to maximize your returns vs. volatility over time. And nothing is more diversified than holding the entire market... via an index fund.",1,Bendycove,/company/Flexport/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Investing-5000-on-Bank-Of-America-shares-Thinking-of-buying-the-dip-Any-other-suggestions-Pls-Dont-suggest-Tesla-SiunVoGk,Bank-of-America

4,"Oct 20, 2020","I am saying that most metrics for BofA have dropped.To buy BofA now,  you must believe that this drop is temporary and things will get better.There are two reasons why someone may think so.One is you think the drop was because of COVID, once Covid goes, the drop will fix itself. If so, I would say that you should examine the assumption. If there are permanent effects of Covid then the drop may not fix itself.The other reason would be that you know BofA is doing something to make things better.

0,"Dec 25, 2018","In terms of career experience, analyst is like L3, associate is like L4, VP is like L5+. VP is a wide range without a change in titles until you get to managing director.  You can see VPs manage VPs who manage newer more junior VPs. Managing director is pretty high level, you'd see MDs managing hundreds of people or being responsible for a lot of money...and then partner is getting closer to C level, managing MDs, etc.In terms of comp, it's harder to relate banking levels. Most analysts in banks probably make a lot less than an L3 faang engineers, and VP is so wide it's really hard to compare. Comp also probably varies more within a band than it does in faang, or at least, the variation is less transparent. Youd just get a bonus once a year and there's no specific formula that will convert your performance to pay. If you're front office, they might pay you based on how much money you brought in, and that could have to do with the market performance of the asset class you work on.Managers and individual contributors also usually aren't as distinct in banks. It can in some areas be harder to do really well in finance without managing anyone.I'm not familiar with citi in particular, but I'm not accustomed to seeing a non ""managing"" director level distinct from VP/MD nor an ""associate VP"" distinct from either associate or VP. there are banks were the VP title is sometimes replaced or is interchangeable with ""executive director,"" but where I came across it, it wasn't a distinct level.",7,Whateverrs,/company/Facebook/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Investment-Banking-Career-Levels-G0N6j7xz,Bank-of-America

We couldn’t go over the deposit amount and had to pay it off each month like a credit card, but it got my spouse to low-700 credit score a little over a year and we were able to get the holding deposit back.

It's less common, so you have to find someone who understands it, and they'd need some way to ensure you didn't sell the stocks, and the loan to value ratio might be lower.Some drawbacks from the banks perspective are that it's uncommon and thus more complicated, and that the ownership of stocks doesn't replace another fixed expense. If you've been paying rent every month for years you can obviously keep paying the same amount as a mortgage. That same swap isn't happening with an outright collateralized loan.The simplest way to get a loan is to just trade your entire portfolio for a derivative contract who's value is determined by an equivalent amount of stock.
