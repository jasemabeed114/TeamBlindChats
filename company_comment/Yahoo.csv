Its shareholders will not receive any money unless Yahoo pays it out in a dividend (after paying taxes). Instead, Yahoo shareholders will be left holding shares in the renamed company.¬†Verizon‚Äôs Yahoo will then be run¬†under the same umbrella as AOL. It is unclear whether there will be a further merger of the two businesses after the acquisition. Plans for Yahoo are still a bit in flux in part because of the abnormal sale process.As for Remain Co., it will become a so-called investment company. This is a special designation for a company that holds securities for investment but does not operate a working business. Investment companies are subject to special regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Remain Co. will probably just sit there, returning cash to shareholders and waiting for Alibaba to buy it in a tax-free transaction.

It makes sense for MM to be focusing on Yahoo!'s core products only. The products that Verizon wants and cares about.Honestly, how many companies out there would want to have 1 Billion monthly active users and 204 million monthly unique visitors? Yahoo as we know it is still huge. Plus, we often don't see the role of such companies, because it's hidden. A simple one could be finance. Open your Apple native Stocks app for example. You'll notice that Apple uses Yahoo!'s finance tools/technology (Yahoo brand within the app is in the lower left corner).Also, Yahoo has a great culture and some of it translates into the real world. Yahoo!'s initiatives have helped almost 160 nonprofits around the world just this past year with over $4M to help communities, women, historic preservations, diversity and much more.We all hate Yahoo because it hasn't been able to switch its focus onto Millennials, but there is still a huge audience that cares for them out there.

The people running the program are former Google APMs who came over when Marissa took over as CEO. They are solid PMs and leaders and would be good mentors for an aspiring PM.A couple of thoughts for you:* If you‚Äôre interested in consumer products than APM is a great place to get your feet wet. Getting experience working on consumer will give you a leg up next year when you‚Äôre looking for full time roles in consumer products* if your after graduation plans have you leaning towards the Bay Area than APM is a great option. More importantly, there are tons of Yahoo alumni working throughout the Bay Area and odds are great that your experience interning here will open doors for you with those alumni.* oath is transitioning to be closer to Verizon so there is going to be noise around the company. That being said, there is still tremendous focus on our core consumer products (e.g., Finance, Mail, Sports, etc). Additionally, working on these products will give you a better idea about building things for a larger scale.* odds are good that some of the standard Bay Area tech benefits are going away (e.g., free food) as we move closer to VerizonHappy to answer more questions.

8,"Jul 15, 2020","@sLsq47 It is great that you acknowledge discrimination is real. Now when you say that there is no benefit of doubt, I can only say that there can be situations that something is taken out of context/comes off as offensive. My response to it is that, so many micro-agressions have been normalised in India (same case as anywhere else in  the world) and there can be stereotypes that even perpetuate it. I think as a person who doesn't intent to wound the other person, the first step is listening, understanding why it is offensive, apologising and making a conscious effort to not do it, call others out when they do it. I know all of this is hard, but I am just applying the analogy here, it is not sufficient to be just not racist, we have to be anti-racist if we truly believe it has to end. Similar with casteism. Again excellent point about the last name part. But a few questions to ponder over. If caste isn't a big deal, why do we still give it so much importance in the form of having it in last name ? Why do so many arranged marriages within India happen within same caste/ caste groups that are considered equivalent ? Like I have told you, not giving a fuck about caste is not enough.

3,"Mar 2, 2018","Proponents of this sort of practice throw around lots of stuff about how diversity produces good teams. However true that might be, I've always felt economic class/family background has a lot more to do with diversity of perspective than skin colour or gender. What's a rich [insert minority] with educated parents going to bring to the table thats  so different from a white/Asian male of the same means. These companies should put money where their mouths are and spend the money and time recruiting at 3rd tier school despite the low yield (Iowa state, university of Nebraska [some public school in a rural state]), I promise you there are good students there who are there for economic/family reasons. Don't find some black kid from Harvard who's dads a doctor or some Asian girl from the Bay Area who's parents are engineers and pretend like that's making a difference, that's just pathetic token bullshit.
