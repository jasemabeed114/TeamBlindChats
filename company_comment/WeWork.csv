As more brick and mortar businesses grow their tech/web presence, WeWork can provide the entire vertical stack of a software workforce for these businesses.

WeWork can basically consolidate the bootcamp / triplebyte / consulting industries into one well oiled package.

2,"Aug 29, 2019","It's simple really. Before AWS, companies had to provision and plan their own compute and storage resources in an inelastic and rigid manner. AWS came along and centralized this process to provide elastic, on-demand compute and storage resources. Their business model is the arbitrage of fixed-cost resources at high volume, which can be provided in a turnkey, on-demand way using massive economies of scale.WeWork is doing that to real estate planning, expansion, leasing and design for companies who need office space. They are making commercial real estate an elastic, on-demand, turnkey product with minimal obligations. In return they will arbitrage the spread.",5,Ohana Gang,/company/Salesforce/,Mgmt,/post/Could-WeWork-Survive-a-Recession-Ms7QSXRL,WeWork
3,"Aug 29, 2019","Ok I understood all of that, but I think the analogy has some problems. The first of which is that there is no evidence that they can arbitrage the spread because so far they basically take in what they pay out. Unlike amazon which spends money on growth, wework is spending money on simply maintaining current operations. I think you may be missing that when the prices of office space drop drastically during a recession, they‚Äôll be left with relatively expensive space that they won‚Äôt have flexibility on. They will suddenly become a very expensive option, and the value add of relatively easy use probably won‚Äôt compensate what will be there sky high prices compared to market.The other issue is that they have no monopoly on short term rentals.

I don‚Äôt know if you read the articles that came out about a month ago in regards to Adam (one of the founders) giving himself personal loans from the company, but that was one of the things our analysts detected. The fact that they disrespected the corporate veil to an extent that WeWork was basically Adam‚Äôs personal bank account really scared us away.
