It has to be a net add to beef up your resume.3) levels.FYI is pretty accurateLet me share my experience. I was in your shoes a few years ago. Long tenure at MS, loved my MS team, loved the work tremendously, on path to promo. Moved to OCI, close to double my TC. Culture is very different at OCI and at first it was very disorienting. But I learned so much from this different culture, learned about how there are different ways of approaching and solving problems. Both companies are imperfect but human beings are also very resilient (look at what COVID did to us) - we sometimes forget that we can adapt and make the best out of any situation.I accelerated not only my TC by multiple MS levels but also my skill sets growth.

Here are the most important things to keep in mind:1. The problem will involve reading, possibly parsing, input and printing formatted output. You will have to write code to do this yourself and, while it’s not difficult, it will feel like you’re writing a small/complete utility rather than just solving a TopCoder problem.2. Use an actual IDE. The recruiter did recommend this in the email he/she sent me and I found it crucial. They don’t mind you writing your solution in an IDE then copy-pasting it directly to the web editor after you’re all done, which is going to make your life much easier cause you’ll need to debug and do some input parsing/output formatting.3. LeetCode didn’t have any questions tagged for SalesForce. But I found several of their interview questions, including the one I got on HackerRank, on Glassdoor in the interviews section on SalesForce’s page.4. Make sure you pay attention to how your code is organized. They want the code to be easy to understand and navigate. Feel free to add comments as needed.
