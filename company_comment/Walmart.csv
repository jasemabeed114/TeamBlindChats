It can be as early as line manager (where you look over perhaps 5-8 people) but it can also be as high as functionally a sr manager/M2 at other companies (you manage managers). Though generally once you are functioning as a strong M2 with 30+ people you are working towards your L7 promo.As is the case with most companies, your promo has two main components - 1. work at the scope of the next level and 2. deliver successfully and have business impact at that next levelSo if you do join, gunning for L7 is about making sure you are not just a line manager (you are building multiple teams underneath you) and that you also have business scope that actually encompasses multiple teams worth of work. Keep in mind that if part of your business impact falls short then your teams can be cut and you will fail to meet promo, so this part is important.",2,bobertjr,/company/Amazon/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Leave-Walmart-For-Amazon-RhQsSp3u,Walmart

0,Mar 3,"Walmart offer looks ok and there is also a yearly rsu refresher of 25%(from offer i guess you are in4) spread over 4 years. Work and wlb wise in IDC it isn't all that bad. They are going through a tech refresh and based on the team you may end up working on latest and greatest. If you liked the profile they described go for it. Company multiplier this year was 125% ..so even the meets expectation( 85-105% indiv performance multiplier)  ended up getting far more than what was originally promised. P.S: I joined 9 months back, was awarded an ee with a 12% hike inspite of not being here for the whole year purely based on delivery impact.  The teams I worked with seems to be doing good in terms of quality of work and WLB. But again I was told it wasn't so before I joined, even in the team I am part of, as idc took time to find its footing(bulk of ownership was primarily centered in US..its now more evenly split).

I know they still have a few old tech which throttled the system last year during holidays unlike US which had done bulk of tech shift last year itself and had a smooth holiday. Sams must be planning it soon as it was def in their task list.

I mean absolutely no offense to j03, in fact I'm happy for him that he's satisfied but I know people who have developed post traumatic stress disorder because of the work culture there and they are too many in number to ignore. Run away from Walmart even if they offer twice what they are currently offering. I know a SE 2 at Amazon who quit and joined Walmart as senior engineer despite my warnings. He left within 3 months without a job and joined amazon back. He couldn't survive 3 months. It was that bad. Imagine going back to amazon. The stress and anxiety I developed when I was over there was a bit much and It quite literally took me a year to feel better and come back to normal.

I have been at Walmart for many years now. I have enjoyed the people I work with and that has been a driving factor for me continuing to be at this company.

After 2016, most of them had left. Jeremy King was a very good CTO - he too left last year. So 4-5 years ago nobody would be worried about culture because teams were really high calibre. But now, we have Suresh as CTO and its only been fee months. He has worked as VP at Amazon and Google previously, so hopeful of even better culture to come. So we are in a period of transition. Those teams that were able to carry forward 2015-16 culture are great, rest are okay.One thing is for sure - if you are self motivated you can do a lot of things from scratch at WalmartLabs and get ton of rich experience which big companies like Amazon Google may not offer in each project. Downside is that because of shitty culture, you may find some things lacking - best practices, best mentorship, output based promotion.Overall, if you have offer from Goole Microsoft - jump the ship and leave WalmartIf its offer from Amazon, Facebook or Netflix - jump the ship only if its very unusually high TC, or role is level 6 and above - because these places too have shitty work culture for variety of reasons and you are better off with Walmart.",1,MXda85,/company/Walmart/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/WalMart-vs-Visa-BkYRmaJ3,Walmart

Let's me start out by saying that both offers are surprisingly low.With 6 yoe, you should be at least a Senior Engineer at Walmart and definitely a Senior Engineer at Bloomberg.Aim for 155k to 160k base with 40k signon (and 40k RSU) at Walmart. And 200K base with 30K signon (and 40k+ bonus) at Bloomberg.In terms of culture, Walmart is pretty inefficient and slow and could be purposeless. But it's relaxed and expectations aren't too crazy.Bloomberg is fast paced, transparent, very very efficient and could be stressful at the beginning. Also, it's very purposeful (many big firms and companies depend on the code ""you"" write), but... the codebases and code quality may not always be good because of the speed at which code is written and commited.Good luck.",11,ixIs26,/company/Jet/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/Bloomberg-Vs-Walmart-RKCkGjJf,Walmart

They're okay if you push buggy code to production and support day and night. They assign a project and give you 3-6 months to push to production and you are evaluated based on that, so people are in a hurry to code something and just deploy. Lot of the managers are there to advance thier own careers by making the team overwork/micromanage, rest are there to retire. They are on a mass hiring spree and the culture is messed up. Hikes are substandard and they have forced stack ranking ( you might ask why implement this and overhire as well.. no one knows), lot of politics. Most of them are leaving or planning to leave. Very high attrition. Some teams are good though, but i wouldn't recommend it since it's quite risky.
