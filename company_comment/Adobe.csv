The product sucks and nobody wants to invest more in the product... the person who is the GM of the Stock product came along as a part of Fotolia migration and does not know how to strategise ... sales is constantly being asked to sell something so broken. It’s so hard to retain talent associated with this product. On the other hand Atlassian is a great company. Everyone uses Jira.
