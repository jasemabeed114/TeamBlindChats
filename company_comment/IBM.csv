They‚Äôll just hit you with a bunch of buzzwords with no perspective on whether it can even be implemented.In terms of actual development, there exists haphazard planning; instead of working on sprints, your deadline is THAT demo to THAT exec, make sure it works by then. We frequently miss code freeze and release dates as a result.WLB is unpredictable. One month you could be working 60 hour weeks on new development, another month there was a re-org and you don‚Äôt even know what your team is working on anymore.Code quality again really depends on how stringently your team follows best practices. We generally would like our developers to run every PR through a rigorous test suite and QA cycle, but it doesn‚Äôt always happen, and when it does, it‚Äôs usually because a release is held up.Depending on the business unit and specific team your experience could greatly vary.

That is something Apple didn't have to worry about.IBM moved from defined benefit to defined contribution (401K type plans) sometime in the 90's if I recall correctly.

6,"Feb 1, 2020","ex-IBM, came in from PwC Consulting Acquisition. You give GR too much credit. She shares a lot of the blame too. I never was impressed with her strategic leadership before she became CEO. She thrived in the ""tardy, bureaucratic mess"" so couldn't see why it was killing the company's future. IBM is run by accountants, and I think both Palimisano and Rometty didn't place future bets on the right technology investments. An accountant would never tell you those bets make sense, that's why the CEO needs to make the strategic bets, IBM failed here.I knew IBM lost the cloud in 2008 when we went against AWS in a proposal. The client wanted a list of cloud services with price per service. That totally short-circuited IBM's brain. They were all about big wins - sell a mainframe, sell an enterprise websphere license, sell IT outsourcing to a F500 company. They just could not understand selling a small thing one-million times. That experience sealed my decision to leave.Going into IT services was a great move when IBM made it, but it had only about a 20 year life as a big success. Once cloud really got going, the forward looking companies didn't need IBM's IT services because they didn't have all the on-site IT for IBM to manage for them. IBM's problem is it doesn't not appear they have any good ""what's next?"" ideas in the pipeline.

In my 5 months here I think I've gone to lunch with coworkers maybe 3 times. Wasn't invited out to bars with the rest of ""the guys"" when in New York, that kinda thing. It may honestly be me but I've never had problems making friends in previous jobs.

If I remember correctly, my current manager received a notification when I applied for a position. He was really cool about it though, and encouraged me to get into the Cloud space.

3,"Feb 14, 2020",Usually your manager would receive an email during year end (2019) from immigration department to initiate your request. I would suggest cross check with your manager that he/she has received any such request from immigration department and has not ignored it blindly.Usually you can find immigration guys information internally (I believe they work from RDU site),1,bskdnfbd,/company/IBM/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/IBM-H1-visa-application-status-unknown-TagTnzKN,IBM
4,"Feb 16, 2020","On visa for another country. Fragomen has been used for years and experiences vary, some are good some are bad. IBM recently changed the internal bureaucratic process and it makes it much harder for your manager to get approval to initiate an assignment. Some IBM administrator does a deep review of all project financials and I have seen many coworkers getting rejections, myself included. Also there was a freeze on new assignments from October 2019 thru Jan. So you may have filled in the paperwork only to have it sit. Only a few weeks ago did the internal review process resume.",0,tDUy76,/company/IBM/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/IBM-H1-visa-application-status-unknown-TagTnzKN,IBM
5,"Feb 16, 2020","Assignment pro is not the actual paperwork right? Do I still have to fill details on fragomen website? My docs were taken in October, if there is a freeze then how some people got and some didn‚Äôt? Do I need to ask my manager to push?",0,TBSwitch,/company/IBM/,Eng,/post/IBM-H1-visa-application-status-unknown-TagTnzKN,IBM
6,"Feb 16, 2020","Do you have confirmation that others received information in 4Q2019? Because there is a policy announcement that assignments were frozen. If that wasn‚Äôt the case I‚Äôd like details- due to the freeze, we lost several staff and had to delay a client contract, which put me at risk of lay-off as I have to wait on the bench.Not sure why your manager would be filing the paperwork unless he/she happens to also be your project manager which I think is rare.",0,tDUy76,/company/IBM/,SEND PRIVATE MESSAGE,/post/IBM-H1-visa-application-status-unknown-TagTnzKN,IBM
