If the current stock price is $10 or less you would be paying the same or more per share than the open market.  If it's greater than $10 you get (Current Price - Strike Price) * #shares = gross profit.

And the pay in the SF office is more than competitive.Work culture is quite incredible actually.However we are a single product company and that is just inherently risky.The competition with Microsoft teams is more an investor/market thing than anything else. There are several companies that use both slack (which they pay for) and teams (which they probably got for free).The fundamental difference between these products is that Slack is out to replace email entirely and Teams absolutely does not. They both have their purpose.There will definitely be some discontent among those who joined in the few months when the stock was valued at mid 30s.

Both have different focus areas and yes there are overlaps.The success of feature depend on how deep and well it‚Äôs implemented and not if it‚Äôs just implemented.Zoom just might have been thrown into the focus because more people tried to use it in the pandemic but, I have been using it for over 5 years now and have consistently seen more and more enterprises moving to it.Valuation is very well valid.Even within the video conferencing area, there‚Äôs room for zoom and WebEx as they have again specific focus areas. And they shine in those.Why do we have these many car brands instead of just one? Because they all have different focus areas and serve different group.

1,"Jun 4, 2020","Slack has poor leadership in Butterfield. It should have gone in to remote meetings as the platform was picking up popularity and expanded. They haven't gone beyond their basic collaboration features in a few years now. You are absolutely right that video meetings is supposed to be a super set of slack but they missed the ball on it similar to how WhatsApp does it in the consumer space. Microsoft is doing both messaging and meetings in one app, integrated with Outlook and more importantly they are giving it away for free with Office. Slack and zoom in the long term will have difficult time beating Microsoft Office. Maybe Google will buy both and offer it as part of Google Suite and give them away for free but Slack will never get to profitability.
