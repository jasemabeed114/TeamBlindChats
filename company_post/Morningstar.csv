0,evaluating my financial advisor's performance for 2017,JSBG53,/company/Lyft/,Eng,"(note: reposted this with accurate numbers previous post was only considering Realized Gains ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)we have some money managed by Morgan Stanley financial advisers. i'm sanity checking the rate of return we saw over 2017, which to my understanding was a pretty good year for the overall market.i'm pretty pissed about the proportion of asset growth we had that went to fees. i'm normally a DIY type person and hate getting scammed. the thing is, this is money given to my wife from her family from before we were married.my thinking is that as long as MS is able to well capitalize on good years and minimize losses in bad years I'm ok with getting fleeced on advisory fees. as long as it's well taken care of and we're doing ok-ish, I don't want to rock the boat.we saw 11.93 % net growth in 2017.without fees we would have seen 13.34 % net growth.hard numbers: $70,242 net gains and $8,314 in fees.i believe the asset managers have ""moderate growth"" / ""not too much risk"" as their marching orders.what is a good % growth? what's the easiest objective measure to look at for a given calendar year as a comparison point? morningstar for S&P 500?bonus question: I pulled these numbers by looking at the historical data tab on morgan stanley. they ALSO have a performance tab which shows 16.29% rate of return for 2017. what is that %? seems super deceptive but I assume they can't just straight up lie on reports..",0,24,2018-3-24 20:15:31,/post/evaluating-my-financial-advisors-performance-for-2017-arft2DvS,Morningstar
