0,Synopsys Application engineer vs. AMD verification?,nofrills,/company/AMD/,nan,"Currently at AMD. 3yoe. SNPs reached out with AE job, said it's pretty hands on and not just pointing customers to databooks.They also said you do everything, RTL, verification, synthesis, AMS design, PCB, package, production,testing, firmware, architecture Knowledge, etc.This sounds really good because it has everything, so lots of transferrable skills that I can use to go to any area in the future.  I'm mostly interested in verilog verification and firmware. Which my job doesn't provide (I do physical design verification).Also at AMD, I haven't found a role that has this much breadth, so I can't just do an internal transfer to a similar role as the SNPs role.Cons:-i feel like AMD is more prestigious and TC Can be higher-AE is very customer focused, manager basically said we worship the customer and you must love that-the team is in a different city, I don't want to relocate there, so I would be in an office near me but only 1 team member works there (this is bad for building a network)Pros:-lots of breadth-thats it...hopefully salary is higher (I won't switch unless 25-35% boost).What do you guys think?

This interviewer was old at 60+ yrs age, came into interview confused looking, seemed tired and jaded (when asked how he likes his work, his reply was was like ""it becomes a chore""). I obviously knew the question well and thought did well in his session and showed positive excitement, so clearly he either held some resentment or took some unfounded ego-issue during it, unbeknownst to me.That feedback torpedoed me according to recruiter, who didn't share much else.Already LC questions done 400+, so not sure how to go about prepping the second go, because it seems like going from old-fashioned companies like Intel/Synopsys, there is culture gap with the nature of way these G/FB type companies operate in interviews. It seems their interviewers are trying to find reasons to keep people out (which makes sense as they get so many applicants). on the other hand intellectually it feels like an exercise in ""intuiting"" the direction (esp for sys-design ones) the passive interviewer is imagining in his head and not communicating, not truly an exercise in smartness or skill. i get part of it's people skills, but part of it's bs too as the interviewers that are most passive are also poor ones in people-skills not suitable to judging others. but i get that's what this game is for good or bad.As this is Blind there may always be some trolls, but still, serious answers only, no trolling please.My question is:- those who went from companies like intel/synopsys/qualcomm to G/FB, how did you prep?- how many tries/takes it took you? did you sometimes do all the sessions fine and still didn't get the offer?",11,23,2020-1-21 01:10:40,/post/Those-with-15-yoe-who-went-to-GFB-from-companies-like-Intel-Synopsys-nCWaby4x,Synopsys
