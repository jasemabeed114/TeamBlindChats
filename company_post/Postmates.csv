This is my husband’s blind account, and I am using his for this post as I don't have one.For the past year since I graduated, I am looking out for opportunities in the field of 'Human Resources'. Little about myself - I earned bachelor’s in engineering and master’s in engineering management with research on 'People's Management'. I also carry the work experience as 'Human Resource Specialist' for 3.3 years worked at Tata Engineering Services both at Bangalore and Hyderabad locations. During my work period I have worked with several clients understanding candidate requirements and helped the team find out the right resources. Some of specialties include Recutting, Candidate Selection, Payroll management, Benefits allocation, Training and Developing Leadership principles to employees as well the higher organization level. I am currently on H4-EAD (which doesn't require any kind of employer sponsorship) and I am based in the Bay Area. In addition to my India experience I have also worked for non-profit organizations during my master’s and assisted the staff in maintaining the Applicant Tracking System. I am very much handing on to work with any kind of Human Resources and Business Management tools. Unfortunately, the pandemic had hit me very badly as a new graduate and with no US experience I am having a really hard time finding a job. I strongly believe I will be definitely a value-added source to your organization. Please DM/Comment me if you or someone in your friends/professional circle has an opening in the Human Resources/Peoples’ department.

There are 3 women that left specifically because of harassment and are probably more...there are male coworkers that have inappropriately touched female coworkers. But don't expect HR to do anything. Head of HR is a friend of the founder and that entire department leaks information they legally should keep confidential. The environment at Postmates is extremely toxic and the leadership is weak. If you're dating a male coworker you're fine. I have seen two coworkers threatened by a male coworker, and coworkers asked to make ethically questionable decisions.

How in god's name did a no-name startup overtake Seamless, Postmates, and Uber - not just overtake, but DOMINATE the industry in half a decade?Just think about that for a second.  Suppose some company gets started in 2013 and overtakes Google in search - that is unheard of.  Suppose some company gets started in 2013 and overtakes Facebook as a social media platform.  Suppose some company gets started in 2013 and overtakes Salesforce as the CRM company for businesses.Does anyone find it mind boggling that 3 college kids with zero brand name recognition overtook Seamless, Postmates, and Uber in the logistics business?  They are now the official delivery platform of the NBA.  They are creating new partnerships every day.  Is this a company that we should invest in for the IPO?

0,Doordash: Tale of David to Goliath,pojkhggn,/company/Airbnb/,nan,"Doordash went public at $50 billion+ valuation last week.The craziest part? It is it is likely a bargain.Time for a post.1) Some history: Doordash was founded in 2013 by Tony Xu, Evan Moore, Andy Fang and Stanley Tang. At that time it was known as Palo Alto Delivery service.2) From the beginning the founders envisioned Doordash as a logistics business and not food delivery company. However, they knew that food delivery was the toughest frontier because of high customer expectations, lower margins and existing competition3) To differentiate themselves, they focused on selection and suburbs. This is contrary to the existing wisdom at that time that food delivery will work only in big cities. While Uber, Grubhub and Postmates battled over cities, Doordash took over the suburbs with almost no competition.4) To win the suburbs, Doordash needed a wide selection. They aggressively partnered with national merchants and did everything they could to keep them.5) Its hard to direct a ship if everyone is not aligned. While the remaining three founders saw the long term potential of Doordash, Evan Moore thought of Doordash as an Uber for X company with the best case outcome of an acquisition. Tony, Andy and Stanley quickly removed Evan Moore. Note this is incredibly hard to do and needs enormous conviction at an early stage.6) One key hiring strategy Doordash had was to never overpay for talent. Unlike companies like Uber, Stripe and Airbnb, who paid significantly above market to attract engineers, Doordash paid at market incentivizing new employees via stock growth. This aligned everyone in the company and reduced politics and bloat rampant in Uber and Airbnb7) Many people still see Doordash as a food delivery business in the US. This is only a fraction of their overall business. They have already built out mature business units such as Doordash Drive (white label delivery solution), Doordash Groceries, Dashpass and Doordash Button. They are also available in Canada and Australia.With a massive war chest from the IPO, they can continue to grow aggressively for next 3-5 years.#tech #ipo",26,59,2020-12-17 17:00:38,/post/Doordash-Tale-of-David-to-Goliath-ZYDMc6rz,Postmates
