0,my manager really cares about the green dot on slack,GEjD06,/company/Salesforce/,nan,Technically it‚Äôs my skip level. My manager had 1:1 with me this week and telling me my skip level really looks at the green dot on slack and told me to be aware of that. Also my skip level would look at who is or isn‚Äôt in some meeting (from participant list) - meeting I mean big meeting that has 100 people in and starts at 8am.I am pretty shocked to hear this and thinking about moving to other team. Would like to get you guys opinion on this - is this micro-managing?

Obviously very high prestige and likely to be around in 4+ years to get RSUs and refreshers to continue vesting. Culture seems amazing, but also very competitive, so 1 bad perf review and you may PIP'ed without regard for previous stellar performance. Very safe RSUs.Slack: Tech-wise it's still a monolith, borrowed Hack (PHP) from FB, and using sharded MySQL, so I'm surprised they haven't moved to SOA yet. This could be an opportunity to help shape it, as long as eng leaders and CTO rally around this. They also have lots of competition from Microsoft Teams. The WLB and culture is easily top-ranked in the bay area.Snap: Seems very interesting and they are making lots of investments into data platform/infra. But it's also a single product company so its long-term viable is yet to be seen, especially with IG, TikTok, etc. So RSU estimate during 4 years are still quite volatile. #offer #facebook #slack #snapchat",3,49,2020-5-29 18:24:44,/post/Top-3-offers-from-FB-Slack-Snap-oOxSP3sa,Slack

0,Regarding Slack (Interview/Work Culture),Circle-O,nan,nan,"Hi Slackers,Congrats on getting acquired.I'm wondering what the interview process looks like for Slack? I read in Glassdoor that it starts with a call to hiring manager followed with a take home exam. What does the on-site loop consist of? Do you ask LeetCode questions? I don't see any questions tagged in LC for Slack.I saw a remote Backend SWE position open which I applied online last month and never heard back. I've got roughly 10 YOE in no name/brand companies and think I can do well in that position.How does a day to day look like for a Senior Remote Backend SWE? Would love to learn more. Thanks much!PS: I can DM if anyone is interested in referring me. I'll be sure to prepare well enough before I schedule an interview.#slack #slackipo #leetcode #interview",1,2,2020-12-3 22:00:35,/post/Regarding-Slack-InterviewWork-Culture-TRDNvsTR,Slack
0,Internship applications at Slack and Robinhood,aoeX82,/company/Microsoft/,nan,I'm in the middle of a couple interview processes I'm thankful to have. The thing is I've also submitted my SWE internship applications to Slack and Robinhood but haven't heard back at all. Both are among the companies I was dreaming to join. I would really just love to be considered by these companies as well before thinking about accepting other offers.Anyone from Slack or Robinhood has insights about your internship application timelines? Any suggestion for me to reach out to HRs and potentially get them to look at my resume or even considering moving me forward?Thanks in advance!,1,8,2018-10-5 21:00:59,/post/Internship-applications-at-Slack-and-Robinhood-DXQiRwYG,Slack
