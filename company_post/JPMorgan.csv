0,Bloomberg Sales or JP Morgan MO,hahibi,nan,nan,"Guys and gals I’m a fresh grad and i got two offers on hand, really can’t decide between the two jobs so i need some inputs from you!1) Bloomberg Sales and analytics offer: $79k All-in comp. Work at Analytics for 1 years then move to Sales mostly. Great financial knowledge and terminal training. Not sure about the pay rise and exit opportunities tho. Client-facing work. 8-6 job but i heard its pretty stressed in that 10 hours lol.2) JP morgan corporate analyst development program: 2-year rotation program, $70k all-in comp, almost guaranteed to become an associate from the 3rd year and pay rise is a must. Not sure about how long it takes to become a VP. It’s a middle office role and idk if i can lateral out to FO. But WLB should be amazing, its a 8-5 job.I actually don’t have much vision about where i will end up in, I’m not sure i like sales that much but at the same time i hate the boring job nature in Middle office, especially Jpm has a lot of bureaucracy shits (but idk if bbg is the same tho). I also like a meritocracy role where i can work harder and earn more vs MO role where things are capped and no matter how hard i work i still get the same level of salary.(As a side note I’m from down under, figures above are in AUD)Appreciate any constructive advice and insights about salary bump in BBG Sales/JPM MO!!#finance #bloomberg #jpm #jpmorgan #mo #sales #analytics",3,25,2021-5-19 08:47:56,/post/Bloomberg-Sales-or-JP-Morgan-MO-DbELqm20,JPMorgan

The start up seems like I’d have a greater opportunity for impact though the JP project doesn’t sound bad either (working on a client facing application).Culture-fit wise I do like the people I’ve met at the start up so far. There are a lot of ex-Goldman employees who wanted a more fulfilling career.All things considered I want to leave my current job quickly as I hate my current job and have financial burdens that a pay bump would ease (which makes the obvious advice of interviewing until I find something I’m more interested in less enticing)YOE:2TC: 🥜#tech#startup",0,18,2021-3-10 15:47:25,/post/JP-Morgan-vs-Fintech-Startup-WxtTndge,JPMorgan

0,Toxic culture at JPMC,VaYc13,/company/JPMorgan/,nan,"Hi Everyone, i intend to start this thread to help people know about toxic culture in certain departments of JPMC. I worked in CFS(Custody and fund services) for two years with At joining i was given 10 percent raise but with a big portion of comp being the year end bonus. And my nightmare started soon after I joined JPM. I was put under a  person who has no clue about managing high skilled resources. He managed people with the philosophy of control than empowerment and often misbehaved with his reports. My complaints were ignored and when later other people complained about it they acknowledged about his behavior but without any action. Instead he was promoted in the form of number of people reporting to him so basically he was rewarded for promoting the culture of subordination. I continued my complains and i was transferred to different team with in the group and then they played it such a way that it was made to believe that I cannot work in teams and i was not given any bonus during my second calendar year. I reached out to all levels including Jamie to complain about this with the mention of proofs culture of favoritism but no action was taken. Finally i had to resign from the firm.Actual experience is much worse than the words above can describe. Wanted to know if other people had similar experience while working at JPM which might help other people while they make their choice to join JPM at least certain departments.

I went to JPMC SDE first (since probably they started interviewing earlier than others and the HR knew me) and got selected. So at this time I knew nothing about FAANG (I was very naive in college so please dont judge me). I recently started at JPM and I certainly dont like it, techs are literally treated as 2nd class citizens here and now that I know of it I feel so bad and there’s so much regret that it’s depressing for me :( Im so upset I didnt go to the Amazon interview happening right in the same lobby or Atlassian or even Walmart or Adobe. Now all these tech companies seem better to me than JPM and I kinda feel extremely sad about it (I’m almost sure I would have been able to crack the Amazon interview then as I did talk to my friend who cleared it and got an idea that even I could’ve. The amazon friend of mine works in AWS and says the work is pretty nice so I’ve so much regret now :( Any advice in coping with this would be really appreciated.I want to leave JPM as soon as possible. Please suggest any good options? I’ve seen the blind community being extremely helpful and I’d like to not make another same mistake again, hence would love some advice from experienced folks.The only pro of JPMC over these companies is that the base salary is almost 1.4 times the base offered by these other companies but JPMC doesnt have any stocks and I think almost all these companies offered stocks which makes the TC almost same so idk if that still counts as a pro.TC: 21 lpaYOE: 0Edit : Can anyone please please also tell me which companies are hiring rn/which are the good companies I should apply to?

In 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, two VPs who had their maternity/paternity during the same year were fired from the firm, both of them worked in the same sub-team within the same division. Taking their paternity leave may not have been the reason they were fired. Yet, what is one to conclude of two VPs in the same team getting fired at the same time after they had come back from their paternity leave during the same year and fired consequently during a pandemic? This while GS revenues were better than ever and even more painful to watch given the firm had had said that no layoffs were going to happen in 2020. I find it hard to believe that the cost savings the firm saved by firing these two people were bigger than the morale and optics of such event, specially during such rough times and in the middle of a economic/health crisis. Management at this bank lacks basic human ethics, honesty and compassion for their fellow human beings. #Thinkbeyondrevenue #finance #goldmansachs #jpmorgan #chase #blackrock #stockmarket #wellsfargo #morganstanley #bankofamerica",139,83,2021-3-11 04:20:54,/post/Layoffs-after-paternitymaternity-leave-at-Goldman-Sachs-4ZJtxG6K,JPMorgan

Other than that I have no problem whatsoever from my job - I like the job, and the work environment as it has a good wlb, and the vibes are positive.

(wfh is gooood too!)2) What are some OTHER roles that might be worth switching to, given my current job role? I'm ready to do some preparation but seriously can do with some guidance from someone.3) Based on my current understanding - Data Science and Analyst roles in Investment Banks (GS / JPMC) might be worth doing some preparation for -  (a) thoughts of people who've made the switch to DS from Analyst roles? (b) Any idea whether CFA L1/2 helps in this regard - to make a switch to IB?  4) People in these roles at GS / JPMC - what are your thoughts on the strategy to prepare for analyst & similar roles? 5) Not making a switch, and working hard at the job can get me to L7 in about 2~2.5 years - similar to what an MBA freshie gets - which is I guess, better than going for an MBA now.

0,Feel like I’m missing something,fi3pd7,/company/JPMorgan/,Eng,"I’m a software developer at JPMC and honestly, I feel like I’m missing something. My manager doesnt like me even though I’m a “top contributor” and have gotten numerous awards at the firm. I’ve never had a manager where I feel like they’re out to get me fired. I’m a question person so I think he mistakes my curiosity for questioning his authority directly.Anyways, I pretty much have gotten to the point where I dread waking up and going to the office. I feel like I’m missing out on some team camaraderie because no one on my team interacts unless its a production issue.For people at smaller firms / startups, how is the culture aspect of things?TC: 130k",4,16,2019-12-24 21:30:07,/post/Feel-like-Im-missing-something-ZjDC2WQ3,JPMorgan
