0,Spotify recruiting experience,pottyfy,/company/Amazon/,nan,"A spotify recuiter reached out to me in December 2020 and it took them 3 months to finish the painfully slow recruiting process. At the end of the process, they decided to roll out an offer. The hiring manager told me I did great in my interviews but they thought I should come at a level below Senior. The salary quoted was laughable, however, given I am super burned out in my current role, I decided to negotiate and take the job if they upped the quoted offer by 15-20 percent. In my call with the hiring manager, I mentioned I have competing offers and would love to work for Spotify if there was some room for negotiation. They heard this, went silent for a second and then threw a fit. 'How dare was I recruiting for other companies when recruiting for Spotify'. They said I should have disclosed that I was also recruiting for other companies. I was like ok no worries next time but then they went on a full rant on how much they invested in my candidature and how crazy the hiring bar was and how they had to make everyone agree to rolling out an offer and so on. Every time I said I am sorry I interviewed, they went on a long monologue on how I would NOT be a good fit. I said 'I agree' multiple times but they wouldn't stop. Anyhow after 40 mins of listening, I had to stop them and let them know I was getting late for my next meeting...This was the most disappointing and sad recruiting experience ever...Customary TC - 350k, YOE - 8",18,51,2021-3-20 03:07:37,/post/Spotify-recruiting-experience-P81S2iGq,Spotify

Shoutout to the Recruiters, it was actually very good contrary to what I've been seeing online.Interview stages:(1) Phone screen: - Basic tell me about yourself and why you applied. - What is the difference between a set and a list- Different types of SQL JOINs- Read up on the role and department you applied forThis round was pretty easyAfter 5 days, I got a mail for the next stage(2) Technical Screening:- A LOT of computer science trivia questions.- Talk about projects you have worked on.- Know everything you can about distributed computing concepts (and everything lol). They want to know how much you know and how well you understand computing concepts.- Understand the Hadoop ecosystem- Read up on their Engineering blog, a lot of good information is on there- Few tech areas that were covered:-- different types of SQL JOINs-- Understand the complexity of different search and sort algorithms with explanations as to why they are good or bad. (binary search)-- Questions on CI/CD and how they are useful-- Map Reduce concepts and example of how to implement it (verbally)!! -- Hadoop framework-- Understand the CAP theorem-- Understand probabilistic data structures -- A bit on statistics -- Understand unit testing and why they are important-- Asynchronous   -- Hashing algorithmsCoding Part:- String Manipulation questions in the language of your choice (do a lot of Leetcode and Hackerrank)- A lot of simple SQL questions to find the top songs in a table etc.- Read ALL the questions on Glassdoor! Almost all the areas listed on Glassdoor were asked.(3) Interview with 3 others (but I never made it this far)After 2 days, I heard back from them.SUMMARY:Honestly, if you work on really big data everyday, this should be a reasonable interview.Best of luck. #spotify #dataEngineer #dataEngineering",9,6,2021-5-16 07:59:10,/post/Great-Spotify-Data-Engineer-Interview-Experience-3vnrndgY,Spotify

Also blew this out of the water.Took over a week to hear back, required me sending the recruiter a note and they responded with ""oh got lost in the shuffle, i thought I invited you onsite already"". Finally set up an onsiteRecruiter called me randomly before the onsite and asked me what comp i expected. I said tree fitty, and they said yeah we can make this work or come close.- Round 3 Onsite (Two EM loops, first was literally them just talking the entire time, with 5 min at the end for any questions I had, second was more conversational) Both imo went as good as they could have. 1 Algo/Coding round (this question was easier than the phone screen. It was more or less equivalent to loop over a linked list and print out a node) this question literally took about 1 minute to solve then the interviewer asked if i had any questions about spotify I asked questions for about 10 min, and then this round ended 50 minutes early because there was no follow up algo question. Last round was a systems design that was basically design Spotify, honestly i believe i crushed this as well (im ex FAANG and used to give these questions)..Result - One business day goes by and they get back to me saying we can't offer senior, we could offer eng 2 if you wanted. No other feedback was given and said I had 0 negative remarks on my loop. I have roughly 5/6 years xp at startups and like i said above ex FAANG. So def no eng 2, almost insulting to even ask.To add to the weirdness, I had the same interviewer for rounds 1 & 2 then appeared again in the onsite.

0,Spotify DS tech screen,iXgsmg,/company/Sony-Electronics/,Data,I was lucky enough to get an interview with Spotify for a DS position. The recruiter mentioned both SQL and Python questions being asked in the tech screen. There's usually a choice between SQL and Python and more often than not just SQL so I don't know what to expect in the Python section. Algorithms and data structures SWE style or pandas/kaggle data wrangling questions. Has someone gone through the process and can answer?,5,6,2020-5-9 08:07:34,/post/Spotify-DS-tech-screen-jpy5UOwR,Spotify
