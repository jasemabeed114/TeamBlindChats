0,Starting Salary at Consulting Firms ,yPYT27,/company/Capgemini/,Consultant,"Hi All. Currently I am one year out of college and a staff consultant at Capgemini working with cloud ERPs and to be honest I think we college hires got screwed on salary compared to other firms. Granted we were college hires but a promotion only comes with a 5-10k boost in salary depending on each service lines budget and we all started around 65k. Recently, after a year at Cap I started interviewing else where. I got offers at other firms and software companies in the same industry of cloud applications for senior consultant and the salary ranged from 100k - 120k on my offers. Granted these are smaller boutique companies but was my starting salary bad to begin with? and how long does it usually take a entry consultant get to 6 figures staying within the same firm?

Also I realized that their work ethic ( working crazy OT and never argue any business strategy) is affecting non-Indians workers, because they set an expectation to be always on call and available 24/7. Farmers built its operations over Cognizant and Capgemini contractors and now we start to feel the shit state of poor quality and lack of skilled engineers with real knowledge of CI-CD, container and cloud technologies. I have excellent Indians colleagues but I see they never ever question any management decision, they just bow and obey without a word, they keep their mouth shut and play along.

0,Need Help on Deciding Career Path,Hadope,nan,nan,"Hi Everyone.  I am asking for help on my career. Please read the two scenarios, I need to pick one.Career Path 1:I got a new job at an IT consulting firm (Capgemini) that is paying 97k and my title is data scientist.  I will probably be working on several projects and spending extra time on work.  There is a lot of emphasis on billing clients and selling new projects while having workers learn fast on the job.  I plan on leaving consulting in two years for a company with a product.  I would be a great position to get into a better job with a better salary.Career Path 2:Recently, I got a new job offer from an interview before my current job.  It is with the IRS as a federal government employee with the title Statistician.  For the first year, I will make 60k.  One year later 70k.  One year later 80k.  From then on the salary progression would slow and regulated.  I would have job security to the point of only my choice to leave and probably would stay a very long time not worrying about jobs.  The benefits are a lot better than a private job.  Salary is the only problem and is also capped.  I will probably be making 30k to 70k less on average as time goes.  I would not be working extra and I would probably have far less pressure/spent time learning the new trends of the field as I would in data science.Which career path should I take?Thanks in advance.",0,7,2020-4-11 19:33:27,/post/Need-Help-on-Deciding-Career-Path-NsYg5eq5,Capgemini
