Should I tell them that what I really want is $x, when I know that some of them (Stripe) could probably pay more than that? If/when I get an offer from one company, how should I handle it with the other companies?

The director of the team I am applying really likes me, he even set up a call after the interview to persuade me to join. He also mentioned he and my recruiter got me the maxium offer for SDE II. I tried to push, said how about redo SD interview, since I care about level, but they refused. That‚Äôs was a week ago.In days, I will have offer from Google, which is obviously not bad. Still, part of me wants to join Indeed since I believe I can make more impact there compare with Google.

0,Thoughts on Indeed job offer for Staff SWE?,wuEm63,/company/Google/,nan,"Hi all, I'm a recently promoted staff SWE at Google trying to decide what I should do about a job offer I got this past week from Indeed.  I feel like my comp at Google is close to median for L6 so part of me is wondering if I stay at Google will my comp increase enough to compete/beat the job offer?  It's really hard to find data about L6/L7 TC at Google so I feel a bit in the blind about this (no pun intended).Current TC at Google is around $460K, increased around 6-8% the last two years.  This was a noticeable deceleration compared to previous years.  11 YOE total.I guess my first and most important question is, if you are a recently promoted L6 at Google, doing good work and kicking ass, can you expect TC to increase rapidly from $460K or am I likely to be in this ballpark for a while?Offer at indeed is $500K TC for first 3 years and then year 3+ TC goes up to $600K.  It's for a ""Principal SWE"" role.Personally, I plan on asking for initial comp increase to $525K and if they agree then I'm inclined to take it. But I am trying to collect other opinions/data before talking to the recruiter.Update: I ended up getting a counter offer from Google for 400k over 4 years and I accepted it. Indeed seems like a great company to me and I liked all the people I talked to, but in the end I decided that it's more important to me to stay with my current team. So the final decision was driven by intangibles. New TC = 560k/year",12,51,2018-12-31 02:08:14,/post/Thoughts-on-Indeed-job-offer-for-Staff-SWE-3oQkmjKQ,Indeed

0,Indeed Interview - Product Developer,Polygonmoj,nan,Eng,"So, I had an interesting experience interviewing at Indeed and was wondering what people think might have happened.I got an on-site, did ok in the interview but felt I could have had a stronger performance on the coding section. Recruiter called after getting hiring feedback to say that it was barely a pass, but that there was a product developer role that they would be open to me applying for with a shorter loop.I inquired about this role a couple of days later. Never did hear back from the recruiter and eventually got an automated rejection email for that role as well.Couple of questions:1. What exactly is a product developer role at Indeed?2. What gives with the rejection/ glimmer of hope / double rejection deal here? Is that pretty common to experience at companies?",0,3,2019-11-23 06:01:40,/post/Indeed-Interview---Product-Developer-QagnWFth,Indeed
