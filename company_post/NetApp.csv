I have done a lot of research of where I would love to start my sales career and the full list at the end if anybody can help/offer guidance! Any help much deeply appreciated and happy to chat further.#Google; #Adobe; #AWS; #Oracle; #IBM; #Microsoft; #Salesforce; #OktaAfter ten years in marketing, six focused on legal marketing for BigLaw in NYC, I have decided that I am ready to dive into what I actually want to do, SaaS sales. I was never ready to let go of the stability and ease that my company offered, but after being let go due to Covid cuts, I realized that it is now or never‚ÄîI am ready to hunt.That said, I am aware that my ten years in marketing do not carry over, as was told to me by numerous recruiters, as well as HR in two large SaaS companies when I interviewed. I was essentially told that I need to start from SDR/BDR and will move onto AM/AE after I prove myself‚Äîwhich I am fine with, as I do need to hone my skillset and am not the ‚Äútoo big for my britches‚Äù type. My TC was 160k in NYC in BigLaw, and aware that it will be cut in half as an SDR, which will take some time to get back up to that number.Much appreciated!#Hubspot; #Slack; #DropBox; #Splunk; #Atlassian; #WorkDay; #Zoom; #KnowBe4; #ZenDesk; #DocuSign; #GoToMeeting; #GitHub; #Marketo; #SAP; #Parallels; #Solarwinds; #Fleetsmith; #LogMeIn; #Intercom; #HelpScout; #Front; #LinkedIn; #Gusto; #BambooHR; #Lever; #TypeForm; #Sketch; #Zeplin; #Userpilot; #IntelliJ Idea; #CircleCI; #Kingdom; #PageDuty; #Sentry; #DataDog; #Cisco; #PayPal; #ADP; #Pipedrive; #Outreach; #Yesware; #ServiceNow; #MuleSoft; #RedHat; #snowflake; #twilio; #Gong; #Outreach; #Qualtrics; #VMware; #Nttdata; #open text; #NetApp; #Dark Trace; #newrelic; #samsara;#sales #sdr",1,4,2021-1-15 06:37:32,/post/Seeking-Referral-for-SDR-Role---Transition-from-Legal-Marketing-1d2ePwSj,NetApp
