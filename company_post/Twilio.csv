I did not put much effort into prep except for SD.Got positive vibes in all the rounds except the bar raiser. I legit felt I bombed it especially around 1-2 questions but was in denial until I heard from the recruiter.Anyway got rejected and I felt devastated, took it maybe a little too personally because my last rejection in an interview was 10 years ago !
