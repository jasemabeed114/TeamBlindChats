This looks like a failure from the company's side.After talking to the lawyer, she is planning to file for a Motion to Reopen (MAR). She has been told submit more detailed description of her role and associated skills. But the problem here is that, the HR is not experienced enough to understand the importance of this process and is talking it very lightly.Apart from the MAR, the company has agreed to file the H1-B for 2020 as well which is good.Questions - 1. Can she take help of an external person to verify / proofread her case (apart from the company's lawyer) ?2. How good is an MAR in this situation ? Has anyone got it approved from here ?3.

They don't care to provide huge value to the world like 2 day delivery and they don't give a crap about automating millions of people's lives. They just care to get 9 digit followers on insta. Insta doesn't progressively make it harder for them to get that last follower. This is true for anyone pursuing their passion or desire. No one will stop someone from running in Olympics for 100th time and win 100 gold medals. There's people who get in 50 colleges and people who get in 0. You only neeeeed to get in 1.Now person B focuses on sacrificing everything and creating a huge company. To put man on mars or to generate sales leads or to create optimized delivery system, etc. Why should it be harder for them to expand because they're getting taxed more?PS: loved the comment about those who got rich without hard work, they definitely should be taxed more.

Now I have a job change in April and no longer have HDHP so I can‚Äôt contribute to HSA any more; I will have a normal plan for me and the kid. My spouse will keep the single HDHP. In this case, two questions:1. Will our HSA limit continue to be considered 7000 for the family, the entire year?

If it‚Äôs not 7000 for the entire year, then we have made some excessive contributions in the first quarter due to employer front-loading, but my spouse can reduce future contributions to make the total under the pro-rata amount.

0,Google interview experiance,bandish,/company/Druva/,nan,"Contacted by recruiter in Sep-2020 (I did not apply from myend). I asked for a months prep time and was given. First round was schedule end of Oct. Prepared like anything, mostly LC though. Had good first round, I was sure I made it. Recruiter contacted 2 weeks later and gave feedback and asked me for next rounds date. I wasn't feeling confident though. I asked for some more time and I got it. Next coding rounds were schedule in mid dec-2020. Out of 3, 2 went fine, middle one I messed up. Didn't understand the problem in 30-35 min and then there was no time left. At that time I knew it's not happening. But recruiter said, will still go ahead with all rounds. Next round, system design, was schedule in 3rd week of Jan. I did not ask for time this time, still it was schedule one month after coding rounds (year end vacations may be). Anyway, I aced the system design, feedback was good. Then came the worst interview, googliness. Interviewer was reading questions from his computer and they were very random. Anyway completed all rounds by Jan-2021 end. Now fun starts. Recruiter said I am running for L5. And since one coding round and googliness were not good, HC might ask for more rounds. But before that there were 2 team fit calls, those went fine but I guess it was NO from that team. After some days, recruiter came with HC recommendation and to my surprise, they were asking for 2 coding round and 1 System design (why system design, it went really well). I went along and ask to schedule it. It was schedule at 3rd week of Mar-2021. Both rounds went fine. Then they schedule system design which got reschedule couple of time. Mind you this more than 6 months after my first conversation with Google. By this time I had offer from another company and a counter from my current company. When last system design got reschedule again, that's when I said, it's enough now. I said NOT to go ahead with process.I know it's google, but still you can't take 6 months for interview process. Also at the end of it, I wasn't sure if I was going to get offer or not.

Or t's just incompetent blacks blaming racism for their own lack of qualifications.Is BLM to blame? I hear a lot of accusations and explanations to this question. But here is my experience. You be the judge. I have applied for a job at facebook 2 times. The first time they never bothered to call. Second time I went through the phone screening but they took so long to get back to me. By the time they reached out for an onsite interview, I had accepted an offer in a different company.The third and fourth time is fascinating. Third time they emailed me out of the blue. They claimed that they had an old resume of mine from the last time I interviewed. After a few correspondence I accepted to be interviewed for one of the open positions. Besides, I felt i had a better chance this time granted I was also recommended by two former managers and ex-colleague who were working for FB. So, I felt really good about the interview. I passed the phone screening and first onsite interview easily. Last onsite interview is where things got crazier. They lined up 2 technical interviews (1 software 1 hardware) and 3 interviewers (all managers) for behavioral questions aka culture fit. After three days they called to let me know that I failed my interview. I knew I did well in my technical interviews but I had no proof if I passed. Anyway, former managers reached out to give me words of encouragement and inadvertently leaked that I passed my technical interview. That meant I failed all 3 behavioral questions, unheard-of.I emailed the recruiting group and told them that I know that I passed my technical interview and it is f*ucked up to fail all three behavioral interviews. Something smelled fishy. Anyway I forgot about the incidence and I moved on. Life is too short to hold on to grudges. One year after, FB emailed me asking me if I was interested in interviewing with them. Old emotions came rushing and I responded rather rudely ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still black nothing has changed, go f*ck yourself, not interested‚Äù. I thought that was the end, two weeks later they sent two black recruiters and my former managers to convince me to apply. I have great respect for my former managers and the recruiters were really nice, I honestly felt like douche-bag. I reluctantly accepted to be interviewed under certain conditions. The job description was different and it was apparent that I did not have experience for what they were asking for. I requested in writing not to be interviewed on areas I have no experience. It was not fair for me or the company to apply for a job that I was not qualified. It made no sense. They accepted to accommodate my request saying they were only using the requisite for hire only but my job description will be different, in their words similar to the old one I applied for.  So my interview will consist of the old job description. Anyway, to cut the story short, on the day of the interview, they asked questions in the area I had no experience. They were relentless, even when I tried to explain that was not my area of expertise as explained beforehand. Of Course I failed the interview, I was left wondering if it was worth it. Any it was good riddanceNow it makes sense why they went after me like that. It coincided with EEOC opening discrimination cases against them and they were trying to clean up.

0,Urgently need resume advice,Zapata57,/company/IEEE/,nan,"Applying for few firms and I need resume advice about how to present my previous role. I am at YoE 4 and this question is very basic but critical for me.Question is - How do I present timeline for Company A on my Resume?Context: I worked at Company A from November 2017 until June 2018. (8 months) Had to leave due to an immediate family concern and move back to my native country. I started a new role at Company B from January 2019 onward. Hoping to move forward now from Company B.While there is a 6 months gap, I continued to work for Company A on an honorarium basis until November to finish up some existing projects. Please note, that my official end date was June 2018 itself - this is what is going to be shown on any background check performed and I mustn't risk putting Nov 2017-Nov 2018.Concurrently, during those 6 months, I was working as a Strategic Mentor for an early-stage startup in my native country. (August 2018 onward) It is not very relevant to most of the roles I apply though and the position was unpaid.Option A) If I say ""Company A, Nov 2017 - Jun 2018"", then the upside is this the actual end-date as per my contract. Downside being there is a 6 months gap on my Resume that stands out like a sore thumb and the timeline looks too short to demonstrate the vivid experience that I had. I've had some negative immediate questions on that gap ""you weren't doing anything for 6 months?"" so I am trying to stick away from this option.Option B) One way I circumvented was by removing month altogether and write ""Company A Nov 2017 - 2018"". Once/if the HR actually asks for it, then I mention that I worked until June as my official end-date - but by that time, I'm already having phone screening so I have not been much probed into a short time-stint. I am leaning toward this option though as, during pre-Covid interviews, I had no issues here. (Recruiter asked about it during phone screening but did not take an issue with the date/explanation) Downside: looks odd format-wise on my resume, not sure if resume cannot even pass screening for a minuscule format quirk? Option C) Write ""Company A, Nov 2017 - Jun 2018"" and then write a one liner about ""Strategic Mentor, Startup X Aug 2018 - Mar 2020"". This nicely fills the gap. Downside is that it is not super relevant to the roles and, critically, captures additional space on my resume.Which option would you suggest me to go with?",2,4,2020-9-22 13:57:17,/post/Urgently-need-resume-advice-spfDJMYK,Mars
0,How ‚Äúrefreshers‚Äù work at Amazon,KoUq26,/company/Amazon/,nan,"Last updated: 7/21/2019TL;DR: If you sign with Amazon, expect only paltry base raises and no new stock grants until the 5th year even if you get promoted. If you don‚Äôt, your TC will actually drop to the bottom of band so that‚Äôs a cliff in its own way. What you see in the offer letter is all you‚Äôre going to get.I constantly see many people weighing offers in here from Amazon and what they see in front of them, they assume it‚Äôs just like other companies in terms of annual raises and refreshers. It‚Äôs not.Many in Amazon gripe about the total compensation target (TCT) model where it‚Äôs possible for you to be rated the equivalent of exceeds and see no difference in pay compared to meets. And that‚Äôs because the TCT model takes into account your current grants when determining how many grants you get for the future. When an exceed‚Äôs TCT is higher than a meets performer, they both can end up getting 0 stocks for a year because for that year, both their existing grants exceed the TCTs.In order to better understand the TCT model, let‚Äôs take the SDE2 role as an example for the purpose of this post. The TCT band ranges around 182-242. Amazon‚Äôs fiscal year goes from April to March so when it looks at when stocks vest, stocks vesting in Jan 2019 is part of fiscal year 2018, stocks vesting in Mar 2019 is part of fiscal year 2018, stocks vesting in Apr 2019 is part of fiscal year 2019, Dec 2019 is part of 2019, Jan 2020 is part of 2019, Mar 2020 is part of 2019, Apr 2020 is part of 2020.Let‚Äôs say you have accepted an external offer 2 years ago with a TC of $242k with a base of 150k and you have that last stock vest currently worth $100k for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 and 0 for 2021. When you meet for annual review with your manager, Amazon does not give extra grants for 2019 the current year, but you may or may not get some for 2020 or 2021. You performed excellently this year so you‚Äôre going to the top of band with a TCT of $242k. Your base is currently $150k, so the extra grants you get is calculated like this for 2020: max(0, (242 - 100 * 1.15 - 150)/1.15) = 0. For 2021, it‚Äôs calculated like this: max(0, (242 - 0 * 1.15^2 - 150)/1.15^2) = 69k. Yes, Amazon implies a 15% annual growth rate of the stock when calculating the value of grants.Let‚Äôs see what happens when your buddy joined at the same time as you with the same offer, also starting 3rd year about to evaluate grants for his 4th and 5th years except he‚Äôs been rated meets so he‚Äôs at the bottom of the TCT band. His base is also $150k, so the extra grants he would get is calculated like this for 2020: max(0, (182 - 100 * 1.15 - 150)/1.15) = 0. For 2021, it‚Äôs calculated like this: max(0, (182 - 0 * 1.15^2 - 150)/1.15^2) = 24k.Over these 3 years, the comp you will actually get will look like this when calculated in the conventional way assuming zero stock growth: 250k, 250k, 230k. Wait what, wasn‚Äôt the last one supposed to be 219k? Well not really because you will have another annual review next year and if the stock fails to grow 15% or higher, you will get extra grants to ‚Äòmake you whole‚Äô when calculating as we did above again next year. But let‚Äôs see what it looks like for your buddy who just got a meets. 250k, 250k, 178k. Huge cliff when being rated meets. At this point, you and your buddy are only fighting for what you‚Äôll be paid starting 2 years down the line.‚ÄúWow this sounds harsh looking at how different the two outcomes are. Are these really the only two outcomes that are possible? Is TCT set either only at the top and bottom of the band?‚ÄùYes for the most part, but I did say the most part because there‚Äôs a slight nuance. The top 20% receive exceeds, middle 70% receive meets, and bottom 10% is needs improvement. If you‚Äôre at the bottom, you will get zero stock grants and Amazon is looking for you to improve quickly or get pipped out. There is a nuance within the meets however.With the meets, there‚Äôs a suffix at the end that is enumerated as: with no additional investment, with additional investment. If you get no additional investment which is the vast majority of meets (since the manager has a budget to go by), then your TCT will be at the bottom of the band. If you do get some additional investment, it might go up to 30% range penetration according to the SDM named RBMY63 here, which means target in this example would be (242-182)*0.3 + 182 = 200. He estimates around the top 10% of the middle 70% receive this additional investment. The middle of the band to the top is meant for external hires, while being rated exceeds put you close to the top of the band.People often say they did get a raise in TCT even when being rated meets but that‚Äôs most likely because the TCT bands have moved up every year so the bottom moves up, not because they have moved up within the band.Additionally there‚Äôs actually a catch that made this TCT scheme even worse this year (2019). It looks like HR changed the formula to screw us even more for stock grants in t+2 (2021 in this case) for meets expectation ratings, internally known has HV (including with additional investment, known as HV+) by suppressing the TCT for that year by ~5%, in addition to the 15% discount every year with the growth rate assumption. This is my speculation based on the numbers I‚Äôve seen from TCT sharing threads, but I‚Äôll update this as soon as someone can provide the actual new formula. Due to this, in the example your stock grant will remain the same but your buddy‚Äôs TC with the stock grant will then look like 150 + (182 * 0.95 - 150)/1.15^2 = $167k for t+2 this year with $17k in stocks, and then they may provide additional grant next year at t+1 to make it $178k with an extra $11k in stocks assuming the stock doesn‚Äôt grow, but the real amount of course depends on how well the stock does and what the TCT is for that year.My speculation is that HR heard the complaints about receiving no new stocks for a particular year loud and clear so they‚Äôve decided to screw us even more by giving less for t+2 increasing the chances we‚Äôll get some stocks next year for t+1 to give the perception that Amazon now gives refreshers every year. Of course it works nicely for them because the TCT is actually suppressed by 5% in case the stock grows more to the point that it exceeds TCT. So we‚Äôre screwed even more if the stock does well since they won‚Äôt be giving new grants for t+1 whether they give us 95% TCT for year t+2 or 100%.For exceeds expectation ratings, it seems like the formula for t+2 remains the same.‚ÄúOkay, this sounds definitely like they‚Äôre out to screw us, but I still want to stay at Amazon because I‚Äôm too lazy to leetcode. What if I get promoted? Won‚Äôt I see a good raise there?‚ÄùYou‚Äôre probably not seeing much shit either. The difference in TCT is minuscule because you‚Äôre likely going to be rated exceeds for the SDE2 role and be put to bottom of the band for SDE3 afterwards with the meets rating as you have a new bar to be evaluated on. The SDE3 band would be something like 250-370 or so. Your TCT goes up from 242 to 250, and all the stock grants you may get is offset by your base increase from 150 to 160. That‚Äôs your raise for being promoted, that‚Äôs it but at least you‚Äôre staying there instead of taking the risk of snapping to the bottom of the SDE2 band.‚ÄúWow they‚Äôre really screwing us, but it can‚Äôt be that much better at other companies right? Don‚Äôt they also have a cliff?‚ÄùYes they do, but that‚Äôs only because they actually give refreshers on top of the initial grant. Let‚Äôs take Google  L4 for example. You‚Äôre offered $240k TC with a $150k base, 15% bonus, and $270k in stocks. Let‚Äôs say refreshers are $80k a year, these are all reasonable numbers for meets. Your first year TC is $240k, but due to annual refreshers it‚Äôs $260k the second year, $280k the third year, and $300k the fourth assuming no promos/raises or stock growth. Then the cliff comes and you‚Äôre left with a TC of $230k. Compare that with the previous Amazon scenario and you‚Äôll clearly see the numbers being higher here.‚ÄúBut Jeff Bezos told me Amazon is a long-term company to work for! My manager also told me the great thing about Amazon is that there is no cliff once I get promoted.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs very funny based on how Amazon still manages to call itself a long term company, at least when it comes to compensation.Over the long term, we‚Äôre getting screwed because while external offers can possibly be slightly lower due to our stock going up faster than other firms in the recent past, the fact of the matter is that over the longer run growth rates have been similar. Then instead of having our pay indirectly suppressed over the long run with the TCT model, having additional refreshers that stack will in fact be better for us in the long run.Your manager is also correct, you won‚Äôt have a cliff if you get promoted. There is no cliff because there were no refreshers to build the cliff in the first place. *points at head*‚ÄúWhat about when the stock goes down? Because the TCT means the gap is always filled, we get made whole right?‚ÄùHave you seen how Amazon treats its fulfillment workers? Not from their propaganda videos but from actual accounts of working there? If/When the stock goes down, it‚Äôs very likely we‚Äôre in a recession. Amazon‚Äôs the type of company to tell us we‚Äôre lucky to have a job when that happens so they‚Äôll probably end up lowering the TCT bands for that year for ‚Äòtough market conditions‚Äô despite the fact that RSUs don‚Äôt impact cash flow. And yeah, that might not even matter if you get laid off.The other flaw is that bear markets are simply much shorter than bull markets. Amazon may win for 1 or if lucky 2 years, but there‚Äôs the other 6-10 years of bull market where the traditional model is favored.‚ÄúOkay, I see Amazon‚Äôs playing a game of TC trickery by luring us with offers that look competitive on the outside but screw us once we‚Äôre in. But I don‚Äôt have offers from other FAANGs, so should I join?‚ÄùWhen you evaluate an offer, look at what your TC will likely be over 4 years compared to getting one from another company, and the worst case beyond that and then make your decision. I also recommend current Amazonians looking for external roles to do a 4-year evaluation of TC when comparing offers of staying in Amazon vs jumping by adding refreshers from that other company by using information here in Blind as well as accounting for the 15% premium for each year forward in stock valuation for Amazon. As we saw above, Amazon actually gives you less than your TCT in grants because it assumes a stock growth rate of 15% every year. It also helps to see what the pay looks like beyond 4 years to get a worst case scenario outlook as well if you don‚Äôt get promoted or unable to find another job by then.Additionally, you can look at the ‚Äúsigning bonus‚Äù as part of the stock grant converted into cash instead. So instead of a 25/25/25/25 vesting schedule with the stock, it becomes 3.125/9.375/25/25 and the signing bonus is supposed to be 21.875/15.625/0/0. I made it say 25 at the end and not 40 because you‚Äôll notice that compared to similar offers at other companies, the overall stock grant is actually lower. Then there is really no signing bonus or annual bonuses to top that unlike other companies.Another thing I mentioned above: If your offer was at top of band, which it likely is for external hires and you have been rated meets for over 4 years and not gotten promoted, your TC will actually DROP to the bottom of the band. Then your TC will be a lot lower than what you have first received.That‚Äôs a lot of text but I‚Äôll be keeping this in my post history as long as I can so I can link to this (and suggest others to do the same) whenever someone received an Amazon offer and is weighing the options.Also I made this post to raise awareness among the tech community of Amazon‚Äôs cunning compensation practices once they are inside so that engineers can make more informed decisions on whether or not to join Amazon or leave if they‚Äôre inside. Please feel free to copy and paste some of the things I wrote on Reddit, Hacker News, etc.",280,141,2019-3-16 03:15:46,/post/How-refreshers‚Äù-work-at-Amazon-pVJmPiL4,Mars
0,What should I have done?,Zapata57,/company/IEEE/,nan,"I am suffering from trauma due to an incident in the past and need your view as to what you would have done in my shoes. This might be a tad bit long but worth it - it is probably less about mental health and more about what you would do in terms of office politics:Joined a well-known startup in Europe as a Jr. Operations Manager. This startup is very well-known and has IPO'd already. 80% of the people - my manager included - were  < 35 years old. Cue the following events occurred:> My role emulated that of an Internal Consultant working with overhauling the Customer Service processes in a short span of time. Naturally, there was some resistance from said department - rather than supporting me for the task that he himself assigned, my manager used to publicly throw me under the bus in front of everyone, berating any comment I shared during meetings. > 3 weeks after I joined, the CS lead emailed how I talk down which was completely made up! (to that, even my manager himself agreed), plausibly to deflect from the systematic changes I was pushing. But it was a straw that started a lot. CS lead and my manager were best friends.> I was the only brown guy in the team and was constantly ignored from team events right from the day one. I am, ironically enough, highly extroverted and communicative and yet, I was excluded most of the time. 6/9 of the team members were the manager's own home country and university. He was openly racist and often remarked how he was surprised someone from my country could speak English so well and wondered why I was not working in IT.> He did not hold a 1:1 more than once in 5 months and was always busy. (Compared to another colleague of mine who joined at the same time, she was European fwiw)Ultimately, my probation period was not extended and I was devastated as I was on a visa. I asked him for the reason and he told me they were looking to hire someone more experienced...for a position that was titled Jr. Operations Manager and the job post explicitly said fresh grad/up to 2 years experience which I had. I thought of informing the HR but figured they are here to protect the company and not me - and would make some other random reason in this case to lay me off.I did persuade him to let me work 2 months extra to wrap up the project that I was overseeing to which he agreed. Project itself was completed in record time and to the stakeholder's praise. Note, I simultaneously worked on 4 different major projects at the same time - I used to work 12-14h a day (despite European labor laws), delivered to publicly high praise of country manager, and got booted. Also got to know I was paid 60% of what my other colleague was getting paid. I had left a 9-5 WLB, well-paid job in banking earlier because of the startup koolaid and this experience completely marred my view of that. It later on took me 9 months to find a job and that too in my home country.These series of events wrecked my confidence to an absolute low level. 3 years on, I have moved on, I'm at a much better firm in my home country and recouped a lot of my lost ""self"".Yet I am curious as to what you would have done in my shoes?

0,UPDATED (08/10): Amazon Behavioural Interview Top Tips from an experienced interviewer,AMZ_Alum,/company/Amazon/,nan,"I‚Äôve been at Amazon for over 3 years and have interviewed extensively. Over time, when interviewing for partner teams (that is when your colleagues ask you to be part of assessing candidates for them) I took a greater interest in Phone Screens where I got to speak to candidates at initial stages. While most Phones Screens did not go well for very predictable reasons (Amazon‚Äôs bar is quite high), I wanted to experiment with coaching some candidates who I thought had the right experience but for some reason completely bummed themselves out in an interview. So I‚Äôd offer them some general tips on what a great interview looks like, then progress them to a second Phone Screen and see how they perform with better prep.While I did not run any quant analysis, I would often follow up with recruiters to enquire about the ‚Äúfate‚Äù of these candidates. To my excitement, some made it into live loops and got offers. The reason why I found this exciting is because in 9 cases out of 10 they would have been rejected at Phone Screen due to lack of prep, being uncomfortable with the interview format, etc. This would be the dreaded false-negative that Amazon is quick to take.So I decided to pull together my top tips and advice from a perspective of an experienced Amazon interviewer. My intention here is not to help you pass the interview no matter what, but to help you remove obstacles that may obscure your talent. I am a huge believer in Amazon‚Äôs hiring process, but I also think that we could probably do more to make candidates more comfortable with how we hire. So I‚Äôm trying to plug a gap here, in a rather awkward way. Hopefully, folks here will find it useful.Whichever role you are interviewing for at Amazon (tech, non-tech, semi-tech), you‚Äôll have to pass competency-based interviews. This style of candidate assessment is not unique to Amazon (a whole bunch of Fortune 500 companies and consulting houses practice them, P&G and McKinsey are just two examples). However, Amazon relies on this format almost exclusively to establish your organisational fit - that is, everything over and above your technical skills. Another peculiarity is that Amazon is superbly precious about the competency-based part of the assessment, and would rarely compromise on a candidate who smashes a technical bar (if there is one for the role) but bombs the competency-based assessment. So getting through competency-based interview rounds is essential, and investing time into preparing for them is not only common sense, but is actually recommended by Amazon recruiters themselves (just read through amazon.jobs content and pay attention).So what does a competency interview look like?Rather than doing a simple/classic CV dig, interviewers will be asking you to tell them about a situation from your professional life that demonstrate the kind of behaviours that Amazon is looking for in candidates. The interview questions will sound something like ‚ÄúTell me about a time when you refused to accept a situation as it was‚Äù. The interviewee tells the story and then answers follow=up questions.Why does Amazon use competency-based interviewing?Amazon is a data-driven business, by their own admission. Apparently, they saw evidence suggesting that this method of interviewing is the most effective to assess whether a candidate will be successful in the business.The general premise (and promise) of competency-based interviewing is that past behaviour predicts future performance. Which is why the story-telling format of a competency-based interview allows Amazon to establish whether the candidate has, in fact, demonstrated the required behaviours in the past or not.Note - technically speaking, the world of HR and Social Science do not agree on which type of interviewing is the most predictive of org fit and candidate‚Äôs success in the business. So every business picks their own dojo - some do it intuitively, some look for evidence. Amazon decided to stick to competency interviewing, and this format is not going away any time soon.What behaviours does Amazon look for when they interview?Amazon looks for behaviours that correspond to Amazon‚Äôs business management mantra - the 14 Leadership Principles (or LPs).What are Leadership Principles?14 Leadership Principles are the DNA of Amazon, the articles of faith, the constitution and, predictably, the frequent ornamentation on the wall. Once you join the business, you‚Äôll start speaking in LPs in 6 months. You‚Äôll be asking your partner to ‚ÄúDisagree and Commit‚Äù with you on picking the style for a new couch. You‚Äôll be encouraging your children to Dive Deep into their homework while admonishing them for lack of ‚ÄúOwnership‚Äù. You get the idea.You can find all the info you need about Amazon‚Äôs 14 LPs online - on their own career website, on YouTube, on Quora and everywhere in between.How will Amazon assess my performance against 14 LPs?Every interview question will be ‚Äútesting‚Äù at least one LP. Which is why if you research the net well enough, you can collect the most frequently asked LP questions and literally map them against each LP.How should I respond to interview questions?You should respond with a 4-5 min story that answers the question. The story should be structured in a STAR (or SOAR) format: Situation, Task (or Obstacle), Actions, Results. Then you should invite the interviewer to drill down for more details and be ready to provide them. You should also ensure that all situations end with measurable outcomes. These can be both quantitative and or qualitative - regardless, you should be able to explain how you knew that you succeeded or failed.Be sure to avoid long monologues. You know you are doing well when an interview feels like a conversation. You should be brief and to the point enough to avoid unnecessary and unrelated details, but offer enough to the interviewer to demonstrate that the story is real, and that you have an eye for detail.How will Amazon assess the quality of my responses?Your responses will be evaluated against the bar for the level of the role that you applied for. An interviewer will vote to hire you if they are convinced that the behaviours that you demonstrated during the interview put you above 50% of current Amazonians at that level and in the same job family. It‚Äôs a high-judgment decision (I.e. no quantitative data), which is why you will have 5-6 people interviewing you.What are the useful characteristics to demonstrate?Even though we assess you against LPs, it‚Äôs helpful when you are: calm, composed and relax, brief and not ‚Äúloopy‚Äù, confident but not arrogant, genuine, engaged and excited about meeting Amazonians, and equally as exited to share your achievements during the interview.What are the top tips to help prepare for LP-based interviews?1. Go beyond superficial sources and try to dig up information about Amazon‚Äôs Leadership Principles that would give you an idea WHY they are what they are. You can do this by reading ‚ÄúThe Everything Store‚Äù, by watching YouTube interviews and lectures of Amazon‚Äôs S-team (Jeff B and Jeff Wilke are awesome - I‚Äôd go as far as to say that Jeff Wilke is my favourite). The more you understand what lies underneath LPs, the more you will be comfortable in unexpected situations (I.e. when your interviewer decides to improv and asks you a question that you‚Äôre not prepared for).2. Research the most frequently asked questions and map them against LPs.3. Prepare 2-3 stories about situations from your professional life that best demonstrate behaviours mentioned in each question. Prepare a cheat sheet with a table listing all LPs and story prompts against each LP. Be sure to have a column with Key Results and another for Lessons Learned - you‚Äôll need them later.4. Note - you can re-use stories if you think that they can work for more than one LP, but avoid doing it more than twice.5. For recent grads - your extra curricular activities, not your class work,  is your treasure chest. Lean into that part of your academics for stories and situations (we‚Äôve seen your resume, your transcripts and your grades - whatever you shared with us).6. Aim for 4-5 minutes for an opening story, then invite drill-downs. If you join Amazon, you will need to be comfortable with being under constant scrutiny. Demonstrating this quality in an interview is helpful.7. You don‚Äôt have to be Jeff Bezos in order to have stories that will qualify for a decent answer. I‚Äôve interviewed seasoned pros as well as recent grads, and trust me - if you have what Amazon is looking for, you will be able to produce situations that bring the behaviours to life. No need to save the world and fly to Mars (not yet at least!).8. Always make sure that you have outcomes and results for every situation, These would have to be real. If you don‚Äôt have results that you can measure, how would you know if you were successful?9. Be ready to tell the interviewer what you‚Äôd do differently if you were in a similar situation again. Even if the story that you told was a success. Amazon believes that there are lessons learned in EVERY situation (I also believe that this is true). Knowing what these are demonstrates that you are reasonably self-critical, down-to-earth and realistic (according to Amazon‚Äôs beliefs, of course.10. Be ready for improv questions. In 9 cases out of 10 your questions will be drawn from the same interview bank. But we can always improvise if we want to. The way to be ready for this curve ball is to really research and understand Amazon.11. Generally, the more senior the level, the more autonomy, org impact, complexity of problems solved and seniority of audience we expect to see. Be prepared for situations where, based on your answers, you will be made an offer but at a lower level. This is a good outcome, but just means that the situations that you provided do not quite hit the bar for the level that you‚Äôve applied for.My final and probably the most important tip:PRACTICE.The more you can de-sensitize yourself to the interview format the more in the zone you will feel during the actual interview. Don‚Äôt take it from me, but take it from the Navy SEALs who spend most of their time preparing for ops. Interviewing is the same - the more you practice, the better you will perform.When I was a candidate, I spend 3 months interviewing around before I found myself in an Amazon loop. I was EXTREMELY lucky that I was very familiar with the competency interview format and had a chance to practice it in multiple interview panels before I interviewed with Amazon. This, coupled with in-depth research about the business, helped me be at my best during the loop and land the job.If you know someone who is interviewing with Amazon, link up with them and interview each other. Then give each other feedback on how well you did.I‚Äôve set up an Interview Buddies channel on Discord - feel free to join and link up with others looking for mock interviews:https://dayone.careers/p/discordIf you don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs interviewing, get your friends to do it for you.If you‚Äôd like to be interviewed by someone who has been an interviewer at Amazon, feel free to DM me and we can arrange a full mock interview (for a fee) - book here: https://calendly.com/dayonecareers/1-1-mock-interview .Or do what I did and schedule many ‚Äúburner‚Äù interviews to run in-field practice.I hope this gives you good start with your prep. If you have any questions, feel free to post them here or DM.Your Amazon Alum/d1_coachFAQAre you just hiring the same people as you are?Yes and no. When a business interviews for a position, it has an idea of what qualities and competencies they are looking for in candidates. And if this set of requirements is more or less similar for everyone, then at some level businesses WILL be looking for people similar to those who are already employed and are successful. I don‚Äôt think this is a bad thing per se. Organisations are sub-cultures, and are by definition selective. Any social group is. To me, the real question is not whether a business is trying to hire the same people as are currently employed, but where the balance between conformity and diversity lies. I personally believe that Amazon (and other businesses that follow a similar model) have got this right. We‚Äôre looking for folks who demonstrate similar competencies that can be evidenced through behaviours. This is all the conformity that we need. Everything else is open to variation. And I have to say - just interacting with the folks in our London office makes me feel great about it. #hrissues #amazon #interview #lps #career",106,65,2020-8-9 20:59:47,/post/UPDATED-0810-Amazon-Behavioural-Interview-Top-Tips-from-an-experienced-interviewer-KpiUdjjk,Mars

Most of these relate to social distancing, quarantines, & travel restrictions.  These political actions have driven a cascading set of economic actions by leaders across all segments of the worldwide economy that contract business activity.   Of course, this has had a dramatic, stressful impact on all of us - no one is immune to the pain that is currently rippling around the globe.If you are suffering from anxiety or uncertainty about the future, that is completely understandable.    Snapping to full alert mode in times of crisis is an expected and healthy reaction and has served the human race well for millions of years.   Although I have said nothing on this subject to date, I believe now is the time for me to let all of you know my thoughts on COVID-19 and the challenges that face us.Before I share my thoughts, I want to invite all of you to review some of the data available on the web pertaining to mortality, viruses, epidemiology, and the history of the flu.   The information available is both rich and fascinating.   It will take you 30 minutes to browse thru it all, but I believe it is essential to our conversation to start with a rich array of facts.   I think we can all agree that it is time well spent, given the importance of the decisions we need to make right now and the stress we are under.   My sincere request to each one of you is please take a moment to click on each of the links below and carefully consider all the information at hand before proceeding to my commentary at the end of this memo.Mortality, Respiratory Infections, and COVID-19Let's start with the subject of mortality.    Here Is an excellent overview of the causes of death around the world each year.  The flu along with pneumonia are the primary causes of death from respiratory infections.  It is difficult to know how many people are currently infected with COVID-19, or what the final mortality rate will be, or who will be most harmed.   However, the Disease Burden of Influenza offers an interesting view of the true damage from a respiratory virus, taking advantage of the benefits that hindsight provides.   As you will see from this article on the King of all Viruses - they are really difficult to stop from spreading, but they are also something the human race has learned to live with after millions of years of evolution.  When we dig deeper into the risks from new strains of the flu virus, we begin to realize that this is not a new phenomena - there are new strains arriving from year to year, some worse than others, and old strains are weakening exponentially as new strains are strengthening.  Vaccines are only partially effective, so while they are useful, they are only part of the solution. Now, what do we know about the Corona virus? Not nearly as much as we know about Pneumonia (450 million cases per year worldwide) and the Flu (800 million cases per year worldwide).   We have tested less than 1 million people in the entire world, less than 320,000 in China (they stopped testing/reporting Feb 24) and 13,624 in the United States as of March 12.   This represents an exceedingly small fraction of the world population.   Approximately .02% of China, .004% of the United States, and .14% of Italy.  Worldwide less than .01%.    It is hard to know what will happen over time, but all the data we have so far on the mortality in China and Italy indicate the virus is particularly dangerous to the elderly in poor health.  This is very similar to the flu.We have the smartest, best educated professionals in the world.   I invite all of you to carefully consider this matter and come to your own conclusions   My thoughts follow, but I am not telling you this to try to convince you.   I just think that as part of our team,  you all deserve to know where I stand on this matter.My Analysis of COVID-19 and the World‚Äôs ResponseWe have a new strain of severe respiratory virus spreading around the world - similar to the flu - that threatens the elderly in poor health.  So far 168,000 cases have been confirmed and 6600 have died.   The world is appalled at the case mortality rate of 3.8%.    The response has been to embrace techniques like social distancing, self-quarantine, and economic hibernation in an attempt to slow down the spread of the virus.   Many people are now afraid they may catch the virus, spread the virus, and suffer some awful health outcome.There are some assumptions that have been made over and over again, mostly unchallenged: The disease has a 2-4% mortality rate. The disease represents a threat to the public health. The disease must be stopped at all costs.   Although those making these assertions are well meaning and believe they are doing the right thing, there is strong reason to doubt any of the above three premises are correct.   Let's consider them one at a time:What is the actual Mortality Rate?  The actual mortality rate of COVID-19 is certainly less than the initially reported case mortality rate by a large factor.   We have 100 years of experience with the flu, and much more data to understand what really goes on when a respiratory virus spreads thru the population.  Considering the tables here we notice that in a single year (2017) in the United States, 45 million were infected, 21 million visited a doctor, 810,000 were hospitalized, and 61,000 died.   If we just tested those sick enough to be hospitalized, we might announce a Case Mortality of 7.5%.  That falls to .29% if we divided by those that make a medical visit.   The actual mortality rate falls to .13% if we test the entire population (or properly sample a significant portion and scale the results up).The proper number comes from considering the entire population of the country - in that year 14% of the country was infected.   For each person hospitalized, there were 55 people infected.    The danger is two orders of magnitude less for those with a strong immune system, so many of them don‚Äôt know they have the virus.   Others attribute their symptoms to the common cold, allergy, or something else.   If we applied similar ratios to the China results for COVID 19, then the mortality rate would fall to .07%.  We have a classic case of a statistically insignificant sample further marred by adverse selection.   Only the seriously ill would ever be diagnosed, therefore the case mortality rate is being calculated as (deaths/severely ill) instead of (deaths/infected).   Of course, the most important ratio would be the number of who died from COVID-19 divided by the number of people in China (deaths/population).  That works out to be .00023 %.   The Black Death killed 30-60% of everyone in Europe.   COVID-19 has killed .00023% of China.Is COVID-19 a threat to public health?As this chart illustrates, we experience in the vicinity of (at least) 54 million deaths per year worldwide.  17.7 million from cardiovascular disease, 9.5 million from cancer, 5.4 million from respiratory disease/infection.   COVID-19 is responsible for 6654 deaths so far.  This represents .12% of the respiratory category and .01% of all deaths.  If actual mortality was 10x the rate we observed in China, we would see 180,000 deaths worldwide, or 3% potential increase in respiratory disease mortality, and .3% potential increase in overall mortality.   I say ‚Äúpotential‚Äù, because as the new virus is spreading exponentially, the old virus strains are falling off exponentially because of the spread of immunity throughout the human population.   For any new disease to be a serious threat to public health, it would have to kill millions per year, who would otherwise not have died.We have 7.8 billion on the planet with a life expectancy of 73.  Simple division suggests that 292,000 people per day should be dying daily in steady state.   We only manage to account for a fraction of the total when we attempt to codify every death, along with precise information regarding the individual, circumstance, and cause.   COVID-19 mortality rates need to reach a reasonable percentage of this number to start representing a real public health threat.  6571 over a 10 week timeframe represents 93 per day, or .03% of human mortality.  The principle rationale for presuming COVID-19 is a health threat is the 10x greater mortality rate than the flu.   Most people seem to agree that ‚Äúif this is just another strain of a flu-like virus, with similar characteristics (attacks the elderly & immune compromised, with overall mortality rate of .1%) then we can go back to life as usual‚Äù.   There are some strong reasons to believe that the actual mortality rate is closer to a bad flu virus:The disease passed thru China, a country of 1.3 billion people, with only 3000 deaths.There are not enough deaths in the other countries to support a 10x thesis.All statistics to date suffer from adverse selection in favor of the elderly, sick, and immune compromised.The average age of COVID-19 deaths in China, Italy, & US appears to equal the average life expectancyChina has dropped their extreme measures and returned to business as usual.   If the virus was extra- lethal, there should be tens of millions of cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths‚Ä¶ growing toward millions of deaths.   If the largest country in the world is able to operate normally right now, original estimates were way too harsh.   When a new disease kills an otherwise healthy 20 year old, it robs them of 60 years of life.  This is a public health crisis.   When that same disease kills an unhealthy 85 year old that suffers from cancer, it might have merely replaced flu or pneumonia as the pathogen that resulted in death.   That person might die exactly when they would have died had the virus not mutated.  For each new strain, there is a decaying strain that is less effective.   There are many pathogens that prey on the elderly and sick - pneumonia strikes many seniors and it consists of a mix of viral and bacterial pathogens.   The 85 year old cancer patient might pass 2 weeks before the next virus would have taken them.   Dying 60 years early solely due to a virus has a far greater impact on the public health than dying weeks or months early at the end of a natural life.Thus, metrics like # infections and mortality rate are not the signals to focus upon.   A more rational metric would be Loss of Life.   A virus with a .1% mortality rate that impacts healthy 10 year olds with 70 years left to live (Loss of Life per 1000 = 70 years) is 10x worse than a virus with a 1% mortality rate that impacts sick 80 year olds with 8 months to live. (Loss of Life per 1000 = 7 years)It seems difficult to support the negative thesis in the absence of millions of deaths and a large number of deaths in the age range of 0-60.   The flu pandemic of 1920 produced millions of deaths and killed healthy individuals in their 20s.   We are not seeing that here.   There is undoubtedly stress on the medical system and a tragedy for the senior population, but no reason to believe it is risky for otherwise healthy people to go to work, school, or live our lives.Must the disease be stopped at all costs?Policies like social distancing, curfews, quarantines, and travel restrictions are wreaking havoc in our society and are iatrogenic (‚Äúthe cure is worse than the disease‚Äù).  If we were dealing with something like the Black Plague, expecting the death of 25% of the healthy adult population, it might make sense to consider harsh measures.   As I have discussed above, this virus has not proven itself to be anything more than a new flu-like strain that looks to be less lethal than every major source of mortality that we have managed to measure.   Drowning, Accidents, Drug Overdose, Fire, Conflict, all look to be more deleterious to our health.   Eventually, it will spread to hundreds of millions of people.  99.9% will develop natural immunity (that is what human being have been doing to combat viruses for millions of years) and life will go on.  We can attempt to slow it down or stop the spread, but this will be no more successful than stopping the common cold.   We can‚Äôt hold our breath forever - eventually we will pass out.  The Chinese have figured this out - eventually the West will come to its senses.The current policies represent a threat to our civil liberties, economic liberties, & physical/mental health that far exceeds the theoretical benefit of slowing down a virus.   They will bankrupt small and large businesses, eliminate jobs, destroy assets, impoverish multitudes.   If our interest is the public health, then depriving the entire population of education, jobs, sports, recreation, entertainment, assets, exercise, bars, restaurants, museums, religious ceremony, group celebrations is certainly unhealthy to them.   The bigger danger is the economic damage we are going to do to ourselves if we shut down production for a long period of time.   Certain businesses, once stopped, can‚Äôt be restarted.   Certain customers once lost, can never be regained.   Like cutting off blood flow to vital tissues - if this goes on too long, the tissue dies.  Death comes in 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, 3 months without food.   It is reasonable to assume that the anxiety inflicted upon a billion people who suffer from the curfew, quarantine, social distancing, loss of job, loss of assets is going to do much more biological damage than the virus.   Take away someone‚Äôs freedom, friends, music, entertainment, sports, celebrations, and passions and what is there to live for? Most of the other causes of death are going to get a boost from a prolonged economic shutdown.  Hopefully our leaders will realize this soon and reverse their course of action before they do any more damage to our collective health & prosperity.A rational strategy to a lethal virus that tends to kill senior citizens with weak immune systems would be to avoid exposing them to large crowds and discourage them from mixing with lots of people that might be carriers.   Don‚Äôt take the entire classroom of kids to see your grandmother in the nursing home - common sense.   Worrying about a group of 16 year olds playing soccer during the flu season seems pretty foolish.  Instead of quarantining 800 million healthy & productive people and stopping their work & education, we should quarantine the 40 million elderly retired, immune compromised people who no longer need to work or get educated, and rely on the 800 million to support them and provide them a joyful reason to live.Our Corporate Obligations to SocietyEven though many have embraced Social Distancing, at MicroStrategy we are going to stay open for business.   We are an essential service to society and our customers depend upon us.   Remember the Golden Rule - ‚ÄúDo unto others as you would have them do unto you‚Äù.   How would you feel if the hospitals, phone networks, power plant, grocery stores, fire departments, jails, and transportation networks all shut down?It would be easy to be spooked by the wall of negative news on this virus, but if you study the charts and think hard about the statistics, you will come to the conclusion that the odds of dying from COVID-19 for a healthy adult vs. an unhealthy senior citizen are not that different than the odds of dying from ANYTHING for a healthy adult vs. an unhealthy senior citizen.   We cannot let this development cripple our firm.    Many of our customers are on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis.   You know who they are - they are struggling to reroute the supply chains, deliver the medical supplies, handle the financial chaos, keep the communication and transportation networks operating, and accommodate the billions of people whose lives have been turned upside down.   They need our help.   They deserve to get it.   Now is the time to run toward the crisis, not away from it.  I expect we will keep our offices open everywhere in the world unless legally directed to close them by local authorities.   If we wish to maintain our productivity, we need to continue working in these offices.   We have prepared our employees to be able to work from anywhere, but unless you are feeling ill, suffering from anxiety,  or have a family emergency, I would prefer that you come to the office to work.  Regardless of what cards we get dealt by local governments, customers, or circumstances, we must strive to maximize productivity in any way we can so that we come out of this crisis strong enough to serve our customers, employees, partners, investors, and community at large.Final Thoughts & Philosophical NoteWhen it is all said and done, this virus will have taken 25,000 lives or 25 million lives.   I have already pointed out why I believe we are likely to be on the low end of this range, and the actual loss of life will be lower than the mortality count implies, due to the skewing of the disease to the unhealthy senior population.  The world has become a bit mad in the last month, but there is no reason we all need to be overwhelmed by the madness of the crowd.   We are free individuals and we can think for ourselves.It is soul-stealing and debilliating to embrace the notion of social distancing & economic hibernation.   In the absolutely worse case, the overall life expectancy worldwide would click down by a few weeks.  Instead of 79.60 years to live we would have 79.45 years to live.  1 out of 500 people will pass on a bit sooner, or not, or die from a celebrated disease instead of just old age.   This is no reason to surrender everything we hold dear and everything our parents fought for.  Previous generations made extreme, heartbreaking sacrifices to create a better world for all of us.  We owe them something.   We should continue to do our work, serve our customers, educate our children, cultivate our health, pursue our hobbies, worship our gods, enjoy our sports, cherish our friends, listen to our music, eat, drink, & be merry.  Live your life.",9,65,2020-3-17 12:52:44,/post/Microstrategy-CEO-email-come-to-work-you-probably-wont-die-EUYMv4sA,Mars
