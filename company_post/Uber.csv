Out of all 5 rounds I had Hiring Manager was the only one where I got the negative vibe and he was a total unprofessional piece of sh*t. Like taking interview, munching snacks, and not giving a damn to any of the behavioral answers. After my rounds were done I waited for 5 days until I politely message my recruiter for any update and that instant she bashed saying don't u understand you got 3 /5 rounds  -ve so you are not selected. When asked for detailed feedback she stopped replying.Guys from #uber is the culture in Uber India so bad that after wasting candidate time and saying you passed previous rounds that's why you went till HM and Bar raiser rounds and then recruiter ghosting a new norm?

I am still scratching my head how Instacart and Uber Eats didn’t get control of this vertical since we’ve been in it for longer? I don’t think it is simply because DD executed convenience better, they have a stronger brand name.If DD goes all in with grocery (since they already have partnerships with so many retailers like Rite Aid, Petco, Macy’s, etc), is there a chance Instacart becomes the Android to DD’s iOS? Reason I ask, I have been approached by recruiters at both DD and Instacart.DD overtook Uber and Grubhub with 10% the budget when they were private (this is actually very impressive and scary).

At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $429. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware.

0,When the market is greedy,TtXy52,/company/Facebook/,nan,"Thinking through this a bit to decide my next move.My thesis is that the recently IPO-ed companies are wildly overvalued. There is no fundamental change in AirBnb business to justify a 5x in valuation. Doordash got a nice boost by the virus but that's going away and there's no certainty about the retention of the users they gain once things are back to normal later this year. I can go on. The IPOs were successful because of an imbalance in supply and demand in the market. There is so much capital injected by the government and too few shares to pass around.These IPO then fueled the pre-ipo valuation bubble. Databrick was valued at $39B because Snowflake did so well, Instacart was valued at $40B because Doordash did so well, and so on.This can't last. The 1.9T is the last time money is injected into the market. The virus boost to many companies will be over by the end of the year.My prediction:Companies that will do well in the next 2-3 years: FB, GOOG, UBER, LYFT, DBX (FB in particular as it trailed all other FAANG companies in the last 4 years.)Companies that will be steady: AMZN, MSFT, NFLX, APPL, CRMCompanies that will do poorly: TWTR, SNAP, PINSCompanies that will do terribly: SHOP, ZM, AirBnb, DASH, RBLX, all the highly valued startups that raise at extraordinary valuation in the last 6 months.Caveat: the above prediction is in comparison with current valuation. The ""poor"" and ""terrible"" companies could still doing much better than they did a year ago, so the folk who joined AirBnB right before the IPO or the ones who joined Snap when it was $6 a piece would probably still won the lottery, especially if they sell their stocks as they vest. However, if this prediction is true, this is a terrible time to join them. You'll be likely under the water.A pretty wise man once said: ""be fearful when the market is greedy, and be greedy when the market is fearful."" If you missed the boat to do the later last year, this is not the time to FOMO. Be fearful and join FAANG!",5,17,2021-3-15 19:45:06,/post/When-the-market-is-greedy-4Eor3v36,Uber

0,FOMO on US TC. ,indiaeng,/company/Uber/,nan,"Joined Uber 2.5 years ago as new grad and currently working as SDE-2 in Bangalore. SDE-2 in US easily earn 200K and maybe  even more with stock appreciation or blocker buster IPO like Airbnb, Doordash etc.Seeing these numbers, I have FOMO that US TC, career growth and lifestyle will be better. I do have the option of moving to US internally through L1B and considering whether to apply or not. What do you think will be the better option ?Staying In India: Pros: 1. Near to Family and Friends. Peace of Mind that I can find another job if fired. 2. Many companies are opening tech offices in India, so better TC in India in the future as well ?Cons: 1. Pollution and Traffic in Bangalore ( WFH removed this but will be back when I move back to my apartment near office). 2. Career Growth Hampered. Generally the better stuff is executed in HQ and Getting Promoted is easier in US. ( Above L5 levels, Staff Level opportunities are very few in India).Moving to US: Pros: 1. High TC and hoping that it will be more if I change company after getting through H1B lottery. 2. Great Career Growth. 3. Opportunities in Unicorn Tech Startups with stock upside.Cons: 1. The disadvantage of moving through L1B is that I can’t change company and only my base salary will be adjusted. For getting the same comp as US counterparts, I have to get either good refreshers or wait till I get H1B through lottery which is based on luck. 2. Away from Family and Friends. Lack of Peace of Mind with worry over getting Fired.Can someone who has moved before or moved back to India share their point of view and opinion ?TC: 60 LPA.P.S: The final decision will obviously be mine but trying to get a validation or reality check from others to not stay in a bubble of my own.UPDATE: Thanks to all the people who have commented in this thread. After talking with my parents and few friends who are currently staying in US, realised I will just be another desi guy working in Bay Area waiting for GC or saving to come back. (Majority of the cohort) Nothing against people who have moved to US, I think I will be able to achieve my career goals in India as well, as the startup culture is improving in Bangalore and few pre-IPO companies are setting up engineering centres as well. There will always be FOMO and someone earning more than you. Everything need not be a comparison and it’s okay to not hustle. ",48,124,2021-3-11 07:40:49,/post/FOMO-on-US-TC-MAhgk3mk,Uber

To be honest I've only ever considered working at big companies first FB, now Apple. I've definitely enjoyed my time and think the comp is pretty good, tech, coworkers etc. nothing but positive things to say!But I see lots of people on Blind getting crazy offers from Lyft, Airbnb, those types of companies, etc. In the 400-500 range. It's got me thinking should I be considering these companies as well? My main questions are:- What happens if the company never IPOs (obviously some have already launched), are your RSUs basically trash?- Is it worth joining companies like Slack, Uber, etc. after IPO, or will comp level off.- How is the wlb, is it more stressful and chaotic since the companies aren't as big?- Do you ever worry about layoffs/stability. Not to diss anyone but for example Uber vs. Doordash seems like an existential crisis for DoorDash, do engineers worry about that? At a big company I've always felt like we can crush the competition or at least be stable.- How is the tech/engineering? Are you able to productive with tooling? Are coworkers smart?Do you think spending 5 years at Apple getting promoed, etc. would be more lucrative or in the same ballpark as jumping to let's say Slack for 2 years, then AirBnB etc?

0,Snap/Uber/Twitter still ‘day one’ company?,leWi75,/company/Microsoft/,nan,"Hi Blinders - I’m a PM looking around right now as I am sick of the Seattle area. Apart from FB, G, some series B/C startups and ad tech/fintech, I’m also considering Snap and Uber based on where my friend / ex-coworkers went. My goal is not to maximize the comp but rather learning at this point.Im curious to hear more about what it’s like to work at Snap / Uber / Twitter from an employee/ex employee’s point of view.Snap stock has been doing super well and DAU is back up again, but I’m concerned that its TAM have been capped by FB/TikTok and international expansion has been glacial. I am not a big Snapchat user so I am not aware of anything interesting coming out of snap lately. IMO the perception is very similar to Twitter (mature and doesn’t move very fast at least prior to last week’s announcement of new features planned)The same questions go for Uber because I have the same impression since Dara took over and prepped the company for IPO. Seems like the Eats business is growing well now but are locked into an intense competition with DD (which seems to have better economics). The rideshare business is EBITDA positive (pre-covid) but also seems mature? If I recall correctly, UberFreights and Uberbus businesses have been disposed of recently so that’s a sign that Eats is the only growth area now?TC: $150k (was $180 pre cliff)YOE: almost 5, Undergrad, no masters#snap #uber #twitter #doordash #coinbase",3,9,2021-3-3 02:42:06,/post/SnapUberTwitter-still-‘day-one-company-itnwJTbY,Uber

0,Nextdoor offer evaluation,hw479h,/company/NVIDIA/,nan,"I’ve recently received a L3 offer from Nextdoor.Comp offered: $160K, 15K options over 4 years, $10K sign-on bonus. They currently don’t have yearly bonus. Strike Price: $7.46I’ve a few questions that I wanted to ask (sorry if I’m asking too many questions):1. They’re claiming that their options are selling for $40 in the secondary market and that’s how they are asking me to calculate my TC but according to their last evaluation in 2019, the preferred price is $20.39. Now I am not sure if I should consider the option price as $40 or $20.39? I read several blind posts and Other companies such as R’hood, Coinbase, Chime, etc are still giving options based on the preferred price, not the price at which it’s selling in secondary market. Asking this since this could make a major impact on my TC.TC considering $40 option price: $310,000TC considering $20 option price: $235,000Cost for purchasing these options: ~$28,000 per year.2. When is Nextdoor planning to IPO? No one could give me an answer to this question when I spoke with the leadership. 3. How much Nextdoor’s revenue been growing? If someone could provide some numbers or percentages on YOY growth, that would be great. 4. Nextdoor’s potential and user base growth? I don’t know anyone who uses Nextdoor, hence what is the leadership team doing to make sure that people come and open the Nextdoor’s app? 5. It’s only available in 11 countries worldwide. Should I take it as a positive in a way that there is so much growth ahead of it? Or it’s a negative and there has been setback in other countries? 6. How far Nextdoor is from being profitable or being EBITDA positive? 7. In one of the posts, I read that the new leadership is bad as it mostly consists of ex-yahoo and Uber employees. Is that true? 8. Is there more room for negotiation?YOE: 4Current TC: $200K#engineering #software #swe #offer #nextdoor #evaluation",4,20,2021-4-1 17:07:52,/post/Nextdoor-offer-evaluation-82cLiTBR,Uber
