Then they had someone read off some PowerPoint for lunch while they huddled for the second part where they would have hiring managers interview quick matches they made.They told one guy (Indian) he could head home and they'd reach out yadda yadda. Then 5 minutes later they came back and said it was actually the other Indian guy next to him that would be going home.Then they had our handler (some hr girl with a weird dismissive/domineering attitude) dump us in a call room (glass walls) each. I sat in mine under questioning stares of employees sitting across, took a walk, chatted with another guy also abandoned in a room, went to get a coffee, went back and kept sitting and finally 40 minutes later the call happened. (Some guy with bad audio just reading off each bullet point in my resume and asking me to explain)After it ended and being abandoned another 20 minutes still getting stares, I had to dig up the handler's cell from emails with my almost-out phone.She first asked me if I could wait another half an hour to talk to another manager, then came back and just kinda shooed me out without much pleasantry.Bonus: they 'handled' parking by paying 2/3 of the ticket in their system lmaoAlso bonus: their 'bonus' has a performance target that probably leaves everyone at 2/3 of the promised rate lol-FIN-",2,7,2020-2-28 14:48:07,/post/BlackRock-interview-experience-c1su0p2z,BlackRock

In 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, two VPs who had their maternity/paternity during the same year were fired from the firm, both of them worked in the same sub-team within the same division. Taking their paternity leave may not have been the reason they were fired. Yet, what is one to conclude of two VPs in the same team getting fired at the same time after they had come back from their paternity leave during the same year and fired consequently during a pandemic? This while GS revenues were better than ever and even more painful to watch given the firm had had said that no layoffs were going to happen in 2020. I find it hard to believe that the cost savings the firm saved by firing these two people were bigger than the morale and optics of such event, specially during such rough times and in the middle of a economic/health crisis.

So I've been doing lots of online courses via edX, Coursera on machine learning and data science to supplement my technical knowledge.

I didnt think much of the FB phone screen but I got a call back. The phone screen was more than a month ago. They got back after a week and asked me for dates. I asked them for a months' time (which would be june 5). They have gotten back to me with the schedule (june 1st week) after 10days now. the last week I really just did 1 or 2 lc a day thinking they might not come back - stupid of me, but I got busy with the new job. I have been leetcoding on and off this year and pretty consistent in the last few weeks. I have very less system design experience.Do you think I should power through and use the time to do as good as I can? As I am in a new job now, I can focus on this and try again after a few months.Or should I ask them to push the interview another couple of weeks?Any word of advise or crash course tips for the interview would mean a lot to me.4yoe, current tc: 145kThank you.",0,6,2020-5-20 07:31:35,/post/Facebook-onsite-EE---seeking-advice-uDT2aY0H,BlackRock

Retail traders > institutions                                                 🖕It’s obvious $PLTR will top their estimated earning hence play wisely.For next 2 months, watch for $RIGL and $TNXP.  Please note, we have a small group (one internal med at scripps, one surgeon USC genera hospital, one anesthesiologist at Stanford, one data scientist Illumina) helping with DD and FDA clinical trial data review but do your own DD, its your money.Dr. Fauci attends Rigel presentations and recently received Department of Defense funding for clinical trial phase 3A, supposed to be very promising with T cell on respiratory issues for patients with COVID-19.  Also NIH is backing RIGL.https://www.pharmoutsourcing.com/1315-News/572829-Rigel-Awarded-16-5-Million-from-DOD-for-Fostamatinib-Trial-in-COVID-19-Patients/https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUKKBN2681S3This is therapeutic drug not vaccine thus not competing with Pfizer, JnJ, Moderna.  Market is beyond Vaccine since mRNA does not have any data beyond 6 months, this is why Dr Fauci is asking people who received 💉 Vaccine to continuously wear mask to protect others and themselves.Clinical trials in Israel and JapanSh*t load of institution money, vanguard, fidelity, blackrock and many more.  Checked linkedin and this CEO sold all his previous company to JnJ and Pfizer.  Harvard, U of Chicago med and Stanford MBA.Now $TNXP, Yes from past graph which shows P&D but this CEO is very clever.Fibromyalgia target pipeline is not only for fibromyalgia.  This guy has 1 drug shooting for 3 others such as PTSD, alzheimer and cocaine (useless).  One of the 3 will pass FDA and currently Fibromyalgia only has 1 FDA approved drug, Lyrica.  Since Lyrica is the only drug in market, this drug is Super expensive according to anesthesiologist.   Seeing previous clinical data, TNXP has a very good chance and more effective, this would be a good lift.  BUT the bigger market TNXP is aiming at is Depression.  All my friends said this is a HUGE market.  TNX 601 and 1600 are both shooting for depression.Our assumption is in the long run TNXP could be bought out by Eli Lilly.  Tired of typing, do your own DD.Please feel free to list your next week play ret*rds.We can stay reta**ded longer than they can stay solvent",3,13,2021-2-15 06:51:01,/post/Stock-recommendations-for-all-retail-traders-to-gain-xYJo4kWo,BlackRock
