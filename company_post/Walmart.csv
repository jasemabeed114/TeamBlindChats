0,Walmart Labs Offer,MDJq47,/company/Hewlett-Packard-Enterprise/,nan,"Recently received a Walmart Labs PM offer, Bay Area (supply chain tech group) and have a few questions about it. I have 7+ years of experience in operations, strategy consulting (MBB) and now working in product strategy. (Offer base $175K, 20% bonus, $25K sign-on, RSUs)1. Is the PM role in the supply chain team very execution-focused? if yes then does it mean there is less scope strategy or big picture thinking? In such case, I may not get to see the entire lifecycle of building product- product strategy to launch2. I have heard hours can be long 60+ / week but is it true for all supply chain tech product teams? My expectation was around 50 so would love to know more from people on this team3. I am little wary of the culture in team as Walmart did put my visa transfer on hold due to internal restructuring (but its sorted now).

I have concerns that I am going from a very easy job in a high growth environment to something unnecessarily stressful in maybe an inferior location to the Bay Area.

Meanwhile my boss forces me to take more time off to relax or take half days whenever I want. FWIW I do not have a partner or kids, but do have a dog and a nice social life that both keep me sane.

0,Walmart Rant -  PTOs in Bentonville,Mr.Doritos,/company/Walmart/,nan,"I have been working with Walmart for a few years.One particular area where I absolutely hate the company policy is regarding PTOs.From my knowledge, a new employee here in Bentonville get only 21 PTOs. Now, this 21 includes all kinds of holidays(from casual, sick leaves, public/national holidays even Christmas).The company says you can use these PTOs as you wish if you dont want a break on Christmas, thats fine, it is upto you to take it. I like the flexibility, but only 21 PTOs?? The industry standard is anywhere from 26-35/ per year. I believe this is exploitation at its best. They want us to work 45hr/ week at least and then will offer only 21 PTOs.When I exit the company, this would be one of the reason. It might sound silly to some but definitely not me. We live in middle of nowhere and there's nothing to do here. Even for a small vacation you'll need to fly somewhere else from this soul-sucking city.What t discuss this with other folks.
