0,Seeking a connection at Aon Inpoint Dept,micscott,nan,nan,"I recently applied for a Strategy Analyst role at Aon Inpoint Department in their Chicago office.I was selected for a video interview, which I have completed already. Iâ€™m very confident that I would be a great fit for this role because of my skills in data analysis and communication and my past experiences in project management and consulting to back it up. Moreover, I am genuinely very interested in this position as it perfectly aligns with my skills and experiences. I just need an opportunity (interview) to prove this to the Hiring Manager. I would really appreciate if someone from the Aon Inpoint Chicago office can connect with me and help me push my application further in the pipeline.",0,3,2021-5-8 07:54:24,/post/Seeking-a-connection-at-Aon-Inpoint-Dept-UBjEv0nH,Aon

By the time I join I'll have 4 and a half years of full time experience wich have been:- 1 year Intern + 1 year associate at a consulting firm- 1 year at a big tech company in latam in strategy- 2.5 years at an unicorn-stage tech company (Getting to IPO stage) (Some in strategy and some in operations)YoE: 4.5 yearsIn terms of education, I got a major in computer engineering in Latin America prior to HBS.Throughout my career I have solely had experiences in Strat/Operations so I don't know if I'll be attractive to the PM role, specially because I'll only have 3 years aon an OPT STEM Visa so I don't know if companies will take the risk of hiring me any ideas if this shift is possible?Also, in terms of building a strong track record for a PM does it make a huge difference having an experience in a FAAANG versus a Late stage startup for my new start in the US? #tech #PM #MBA #FAANG #Uber #product #productmanager #pm",4,2,2021-2-24 04:55:20,/post/International-HBS-student-w-Strategy-experience---attractive-for-PM-role-nO6pZrcC,Aon
