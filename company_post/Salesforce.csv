0,Humiliated by Salesforce,fundo,/company/SAP/,nan,"Hey all,This is a very very interesting story.I got a call from salesforce. I gave hackerrank of 3 hours. Then I moved forward in the interview process.After that, I was redirected to another position. Gave all the interviews. Went very well. Talked with the director, explained, “salesforce has a cultural who cares about people a lot.” I got very impressed. Literally interviewed by 6-7 people on the team. All sent very positive feedback.After following up with the recruiter multiple times (again), Her words were in the email, “we are moving to the offer, congratulations!”. I was so excited. Then nothing, again followed up with her for few times.Then, The recruiter calls and asks me to join as MTS, I have more than 5.5 years of experience, they were offering me almost the same amount as my current employer. I asked the recruiter that I would like to be considered as SMTS instead of MTS(the job description was not provided and the role was not clarified previously). The recruiter said he/she will get back to me with an update.My entire interview went so well, I knew there is something wrong with the communication. My recruiter took forever to get back to me.No response for few days, after again following up with her, she is said ""I am on pause.""Then again after following with her she emailed she can not give me an offer because the team does not have HEADCOUNT. I requested the recruiter if we can have communicated for 10 minutes. Did not respond. In the entire process, I performed well, only in negotiations call there might be some misunderstandings happened. So, I emailed the hiring manager ccd recruiter (as she does not respond for two days) that even if they offer me MTS that is okay because I liked the team.About my recruiter: Does not respond, only responds once in two days at 7 AM PST.Now SURPRISE!!!!!A recruiter calls me within 10 minutes of that email which I sent both the hiring manager and recruiter. She was really pissed and talking loudly to me. Very very disrespectful. I literally requested her to talk to me with a lower tone and respect. I think she got pissed because now the hiring manager can see how she was responding in that email thread. She said few things that really made me doubt the culture of the salesforce,1. You are incompetent to be considered SMTS. Your skillsets are not enough. After few minutes, Even if we have hired you, you would not have accepted the offer. (how does she know? blaming me to save herself). She said we were moving to the offer I did give you a verbal offer and we are taking it back. THIS HAPPENS IN ALL THE COMPANIES AND THIS IS GENERAL PRACTICE TO GET HEADCOUNT AFTER!2. English is my second language so I can not speak as fluently as she does. after insulting me for 15 minutes, she said “you have problems, you can not understand.”3. Did not give me space to talk even if I repeatedly requested her “may I please say something?”4. Said, “ You are upset because you did not get the offer. You have problems.”5. She talked entirely in 30 minutes of the phone conversation, when I tried to speak she was slack messaging someone and completely ignored what I was trying to say. and she told me I am sorry I was typing something in slack.I felt insulted, humiliated, and disrespected in this entire process. Such a bummer and waste of time.I know the recruiter will know who I am but I am not afraid. I am strong enough to raise a voice against what is wrong. So another person like me does not go through this humiliating and insulting process. I want to request salesforce recruiters and managers not to interview for 7 rounds if you don't have HEADCOUNT. First, get a headcount and then interview. I also feel a little unlucky that I got to connect with this manager and recruiter in Salesforce. Hopefully, everyone is not the same. 😊YOE: 5.5TC: 180k#salesforce @salesforce #tech #softwareengineer",4,45,2021-3-5 23:38:12,/post/Humiliated-by-Salesforce-UtUCxQLD,Salesforce

The domain is something I am really passionate about and my past experience complements it, and I am pretty confident about moving to Senior Director in less than two years.But I am also worried that I may lose out on an excellent opportunity and money that comes with Google offer. Also, stock refreshers at Google are much higher than Salesforce (if I get any). Still, I also believe promotions/growth is challenging & painful in Google, especially moving to L7 from L6 considering my past experience does not complement the work I would be doing at Google and there would be a good ramp-up period.I am looking for a longer-term change and hence looking for someplace to have a good time without burning too much of midnight oil. Also, I am not sure which company would fare well during this Covid situation and beyond.

0,Salesforce SMTS Promotion,thelearner,/company/Salesforce/,nan,"I have a promotion coming up here at Salesforce (MTS --> SMTS). I am trying to gauge salaries in the non bay-area (or Seattle). Trying to be vague on the location and other information for anonymity, but here are the numbers.Location: Midwest areaYOE: 3+Years with SF: 3+Base Pay: 120-125kRSU: 8-10k/yrBonus: 10% (Default based on title).Overall, judging by the numbers here at Blind along with other websites, I feel low-balled, but I could be wrong. There's not much data outside of the bay-area, so I am trying to figure out expectations and what a reasonable pay-bump would be for this upcoming promotion or if I should just look for a new job elsewhere.I'm hoping to get (since apparently negotiating is not a thing):Base Pay:155kRSU Renewal: 25k/yr (on top of the 10k/year I have left over from my initial contract)Bonus: 15% (Default based on title).It's a pretty big pay bump, so not sure if Salesforce (or other companies) have some ""rule"" on raises and its percentages, but I guess time will tell.#engineering #software #salesforce #promotion #smts",2,2,2020-10-2 23:34:37,/post/Salesforce-SMTS-Promotion-VVuup0w5,Salesforce
0,Salesforce Recruiting Issues,crooza172,/company/SAIC/,nan,I don’t understand salesforce recruiting or if I am doing something wrong.  I applied to a bunch of positions including positions with a significantly lower skill and YOE requirement than I have and get promptly rejected.  I have not even been able to make it to chat with a recruiter.Has anyone else had a similar experience?  How can I get over this hump??  Any help would be greatly appreciated.YOE: 15#salesforce #salesforceinterview #recruiting,2,17,2021-3-9 20:51:24,/post/Salesforce-Recruiting-Issues-3su6F8MQ,Salesforce

But I’m looking at this TC sheet and it seems like AE is general trajectory after 2-2.5 years here but you make 120 or so 50/50 split.It seems like if you have 3 or so years of experience as a top performer in a competitive environment you can be doing much better. However, there is somewhat consistent upward mobility here (every 1.5-2 years). Seems like AWS is doing much better though and idc that much about WLB as I’m only 24.How should I be thinking about maximizing my income in this space?Right now:SDR - 1 year - 60k (almost done) - Chicago BDR - 1.25 years - 75-80k - NYC (want to switch offices)Small Business AE - 1.5 years - 120k 50/50 split uncapped commission - NYCGrowth Business AE - ? - ? - ?Does it make sense to stay here and climb ladder??",2,13,2020-10-9 15:14:44,/post/Salesforce-TC-gYrYMsid,Salesforce
