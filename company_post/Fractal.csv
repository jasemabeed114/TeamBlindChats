0,Interesting interview experience at SpaceX,rotel,/company/NVIDIA/,nan,"I had an eyebrow raising experience in the interview process. I have a doctorate in physics, 30 years of programming experience (since I was a kid, actually, I knew Niklaus Wirth's book by heart in the eighths grade, was writing recursive programs for fractals, knew Fortran, Pascal, C, PDP11 assembler when I was in school), and work for 18 years in the SW industry. I applied for a physics simulation position. An ideal blend for me: half physics, half software engineering. The technical quiz was interesting, even with a physics question in the end. Then they had a programming challenge: a task for 6 hours. Since this is a physics simulation position, I expected something like: interpolate this function, filter out noise, solve an integral equation numerically and estimate an error, minimize computation error here, use finite elements method to solve this equation, regularize an ill-posed problem, etc.The problem I received instead was a primitive DB task to print out a check out of the cash register using an input from the scanner. The product database was in a text file and the scanner output is a set of integers. So it's a simple task of reading a db, indexing and search for records. There's some complication with discount cards. But it's pretty straightforward.Now the interesting part. It's C++. But I cannot use any standard library means. I.e. I have to write my own containers, sorting algorithms, tree search, etc. Really? The last time I had to think about sorting implementation was in 80s. It's absolutely unrelated neither to the contemporary software engineering nor, most of all, to the physics simulation. Don't get me wrong, I know the CS stuff, algorithms complexity, sorting, etc. But I would have fired a dude who had tried to implement his own sorting algorithm or his own container. Also as a senior engineer, I know that even an accurate container in C++ with strong exception safety requires more than 6 hours of work. Save a balanced tree implementation.To set the perspective right, I came up with an anology. Imagine you are an experienced chef applying to a position in a very fancy world famous French restaurant. They organize an important 6 hours test for your skills. When you arrive the task is to peel potatoes with a pocket knife. You will be like: hmm... hey guys, am I at the right place? Is it really the position I applied for? Why should I spend 6 hours of my life doing that?When I voiced my concerns, they were: sorry you have decided not to pursue this position, good luck with your endeavors, and everything, etc. I.e. basically they said to eff off.Wow, guys. Good luck in search for a good senior engineer with this approach. :-D",38,30,2018-8-19 23:06:32,/post/Interesting-interview-experience-at-SpaceX-w4OH7Try,Fractal
