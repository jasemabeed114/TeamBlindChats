0,Losing respect. I wish I could be normal again.,hsoqh,/company/Yahoo/,nan,"I worked in the industry for 13 years. And I worked with many different managers. I have a lovely wife and a daughter. I support all of the sentiments and genuine push for more females at the workplace, equal pay, and equal treatment.Recently I have a female manager and working with her I lost all the respect for women (at least as managers). The amount of verbal pressure, verbal misbehave, crazy loud voice drama, anger issues, impulsivity, and poor performance review and increments make me feel worthless. I had to take so many sick time offs in the past to keep up with the job. The stranger silent treatment from her (for days) during work discussion, and during 1:1 she says something and does exactly opposite. It broke all my confidence and destroyed my mental state to a point my home is affected. I never used to be so easily irritated. One thing I admire her is her luck, that she is still able to survive while being so feeling less, full of personal ego, micromanaging, over controlling, cannot see the reality, can continue surviving as abusive and childish, and treating me as if I am a criminal and I am responsible for women suffrage in the past. I used to support her women in network events, as time permits, and with time I was so much over abused that I distanced myself from all events and her in the social setting. I am so broken and crushed, I do not think I can ever afford to work with a female manager in the future. I am still looking for a job opportunity so I can take time to get normal. There have been multiple times in the past I literally cried in front of my wife and talked all about this with my wife, she also suggests finding another job.

However I've been thinking about my future as an engineer and I believe I might get bored of coding all my life. I would probably want to move into product management or leadership roles(VP 15-20 years from now) further down my path. However at this stage I cannot decide if I should be getting an MBA degree for this. My question to people who read this is, did you ever wish you had pursued an MBA? Has there been moments in your life when you feel that your professional growth has stagnated because you did not have a masters degree? A follow up question to any MBA grads reading this is, is it really worth getting a super expensive degree from the US if my long term plans are to settle down in India?A counter viewpoint - having started my career strongly with Amazon, can I expect to have a stronger growth than average if I put in the effort, and potentially get away with not doing an MBA?I'm 23 right now but I feel these decisions need to be made early so that I can prepare myself for what I want 10 years from now.

0,"A reckoning for tech: 2020-21 IPOs SNOW, COIN, Dash, BMBL, Wish, CPNG, and OPEN record all-time low stock prices today",BigNIntern,/company/RBC/,Eng,"8 of the biggest COVID tech IPOs including Snowflake, Airbnb and Opendoor, in 6 different categories (cloud, crypto, gig economy, app economy, e-commerce, and real estate), all crashed following stellar public offerings. Prices rounded to the nearest digit.SNOW went down from its $430 ATH in Dec to 314 in Feb to 232 on Apr 30 and 185 today.COIN sunk from its ATH of 429 to 250 after narrowly missing earnings expectations today. At one point on the day of its IPO, retail traders were lapping up COIN for as much as $429. I will note though that BTC crashed yday for those unaware. As if ARKK bagholders weren't hurting enough!DASH crashed from its ATH of $256 in late Feb to $110 yday before reporting a bigger-than-expected loss today. They're up 8% in after-hours.BMBL halved from its $85 ATH to $39 after beating expectations yday.WISH crashed from its ATH of 33 to 8 after earnings yday.CPNG is down from its ATH of 69 to 31 after reporting a higher than expected adjusted loss yday.SPAC merger Opendoor crashed from $39 in Feb to its all-time low of 11 today after Tuesday earnings.ABNB crashed from $220 on Apr 28 to $133 after-hours today, down from its ATH of $217 on Feb 11 and up from its ATL of $125. The company announced today that their net loss tripled and employees can finally sell their RSUs next week.The one newly public tech company that seems to have weathered the storm is Roblox, which fell from its ATH of $83 to $61 on Monday, before recovering $70 as of today.But it's not just tech companies that IPOd in 2020-2021. 2019 IPOs Lyft, Uber, Pinterest, and Snap - which, except for Lyft, all reached their ATHs during COVID - saw significant gains during the pandemic, have also crashed since the end of April.LYFT tanked from $63 on Apr 28 to 46 today. Previously, Lyft dipped below $23 (ATH is close to $80) three times during COVID, most recently in Oct.In the same time period, UBER crashed from $58 to $44.PINS is down from 78 to 55 since Apr 27.SNAP dipped below $50 from 70 from Feb 23 to Mar 29 and is trading at 50 again today.These companies aren't just sliding in after-hours or on the day after reporting earnings, we're looking at a prolonged downward trend either preceding or following earnings.TL;DR: RIP retail investors that bought into COVID IPOs.",11,19,2021-5-14 02:17:11,/post/A-reckoning-for-tech-2020-21-IPOs-SNOW-COIN-Dash-BMBL-Wish-CPNG-and-OPEN-record-all-time-low-stock-prices-today-2h4R2xJV,Wish

0,What do you wish you knew when you were 22 money wise?,HowardZinn,/company/Google/,Eng,"Hey everyone,I'm a recent new grad who's a swe at Google now (for about 6 months). I went from making peanuts to a lot of money, but I'm honestly lost in what the smart things to do are. My family doesn't come from much money, so their only advice is to buy property lol.Just a bit about my situation: I have about $40k in a checking account, $4500 in wealthfront, and 100 Goldman stocks that my mom bought for me as a kid. I didn't catch the memo that maxing out the 401k was the smart thing to do, but I'll be sure to do that next year. In general I'm very conservative with money, but I'd like to secure a good future for myself. My biggest fear in the world is that I do something dumb, tech jobs go south, and I have no money, so I'd appreciate any advice or words of wisdom :)",4,47,2017-12-26 21:10:06,/post/What-do-you-wish-you-knew-when-you-were-22-money-wise-3T4C0iUF,Wish

0,Why do you wish commute and high col on your colleagues just because you don't have any friends?,genie 👻,/company/Google/,nan,"The ""I wish WFH stops because I miss socializing with my teammates"" folks remind me of that old joke with three shipwrecked sailors stranded on a deserted island fishing out a genie in a bottle:Genie: Ok, I usually grant three wishes. There's three of you, so I'll grant one wish each. Go ahead.First: I wish I'm back with my family. [Poof, he disappears.]Second: I wish I'm back with my lover. [Poof, he disappears.]Third: Oh, it will be boring being alone here... Now I wish the two of them were back here with me.When companies will look at the polls deciding should we stay WFH, or will there be mandatory RTO... the numbers won't be really good for WFH. Those of you hungry for socialization will basically screw up the lives for the rest who want to stay home.Really, folks... Don't be the third guy there. Find some IRL friends. Get a dog. Or something. Just know that every time you vote ""I want RTO"" in the polls - you're screwing up your colleagues.",37,32,2020-9-24 04:38:57,/post/Why-do-you-wish-commute-and-high-col-on-your-colleagues-just-because-you-dont-have-any-friends-JONa4jrt,Wish
