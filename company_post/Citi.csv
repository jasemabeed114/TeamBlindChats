0,Citi SVP to JP Morgan VP Transition,Leo23,/company/Citi/,nan,"#interview #finance #citi #jpmorgan #jpmorganchaseBecame a SVP at Citi just a few weeks back. Interviewing for VP position at JP. As many of you may already know, SVP designation doesn’t exist at JP.Would this transition make sense? Hope I am not diluting my designation by making this move. As I became a SVP just a while back, ED at JP (equivalent to Director at Citi) would not be possible at the moment.Comments? Advice?EDIT:Thanks for all the comments below. I genuinely appreciate all the advice. Positive comments made me ponder and the negative ones made me smile. 🙂Based on whatever I read.- Current TC: $200K- JP offer: $250K TC (although I didn’t talk with the HR about the band I would be in)- I didn’t push for ED as I became SVP just a while back. Honestly I wasn’t even thinking about the switch. The recruiter reached out and I just gave the interviews.- Turning 31 soon- Did my undergrad and MBA from ivy leagues. Had an offer from a bulge bracket bank in M&A but wanted something different in life. M&A folks make money but I find their job really monotonous and boring. Not challenging in my opinion. I wanted to solve complex business problems and got this interesting role at Citi (not sharing too many details).- I am sorry but I can’t just chase tc. No offense to anyone else here.- The role at JP seems more challenging than my current role.- I also needed more time for my other passions. With this job, I get more time to focus on my fitness. I have completed a few ironman triathlons across the country. Workout 6 days a week (2 hrs a day) with dedication. Could be 4 hrs a day when I am about to participate in a triathlon.- I can wrap up my daily office work in literally 2-3 hrs (other than a few busy days) which gives me a lot of time to focus on my startup as well. I want to build something of my own and have been working diligently on it.- I love to invest. Trade stocks and crypto. Forex trading during the night time.- I play flute and am really great at it.- Have travelled across the world and ran across various mountain ranges in Europe and South AmericaSo please understand that each person has a different and unique definition of success. Success is not always about the tc. I have envisioned a different kind of life for myself. One that would be more fulfilling for me. But to each their own. Love and respect for all of you. 🙂",73,181,2021-2-9 03:56:18,/post/Citi-SVP-to-JP-Morgan-VP-Transition-4ZNCUjRE,Citi

Is quant pay in the UK reflective of the US or am I capping my ceiling at a much lower bar than the IB route?- What is the probability of getting the highly prestigious quant role I seek e.g. QR at a hedge fund or that of a quantitative trader?

0,Shitty Citibank India work culture,frankUW,/company/Citi/,nan,"Note : Venting out my frustration with this postI rejoined CITI (Pune) after taking a career break of over 2.5 years. I had very options when I had decided to get back into a job after the career break; and thus I had thought that I will work at CITI for a while before switching to a better company.Before my career break, I had joined CITI as a grad and worked for a year after which I took a break.But it has been horrible few months since I had rejoined. Detailing few experiences :1. We [another grad and me] started working on a new feature about 2 months back and we coded it to completion within a week. But only to realise that requirements have been changed.2. This happened many a times over last 2 months. Until it finally managed to get into production.3. Since last 2 weeks, I had hardly written any code. I am mostly working on test cases and making sure that existing functionalities can be tested via this new Testing framework that the team has.4. For writing test cases I would need my mentor's help, for understanding the flow and scenario in a better way. But my mentors are always busy with their production issues. I thereby don't get any help and further delays [on getting test cases done] gets blamed on me.5. I feel like my mentors have developed this attitude that I don't work (or) delay work. Which is really not the case. I try hard to get things done even with minimal documentation, their lack of help. But still, it's unsatisfactory.6. Work wise : coding - 10% + config/setup - 90%. Highly unsatisfactory.Since I had worked at CITI before, I knew that work isn't great [and neither the pay] but this time with unhelpful mentors, its even horrible.I really wanna quit at this point and join any startup that can pay me decently and I get to code and learn [and somehow compensate for that career gap] and eventually getting into the TC race.I should really really start LC and get myself prepared for a switch; hopefully by next 4-5 months [do link me up any preparatory guide].YOE - 1.5TC - 15#engineering #software #swe",2,8,2021-3-9 12:19:30,/post/Shitty-Citibank-India-work-culture-mzd2tnfx,Citi

I’ve spoken to people here as to why, and they say that it’s just super common to find people who work at FAANG in SF.Is this the same in other major cities?

He was wrong. To prevent payment of the principal, Raj actually needed to set the ""front"" and ""fund"" fields to the wash account as well as ""principal."" Raj didn't do that.Citibank's procedures require that three people sign off on a transaction of this size. In this case, that was Raj, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware named Vincent Fratta. All three believed that setting the ""principal"" field to an internal wash account number would prevent payment of the principal. As he approved the transaction, Fratta wrote: ""looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash.""But the principal wasn't going to wash. When Raj conducted a routine review the next morning, he noticed there was something drastically off about the previous day's figures. Citibank had actually sent out almost $900 million, not the $7.8 million it was trying to send.Citibank then scrambled to get the funds back, notifying each creditor that the principal payments had been made by mistake. Some of the creditors sent the money back. But others refused, leaving Citibank out $500 million.",8,4,2021-2-18 14:41:36,/post/Citi-got-a-500M-lesson-due-to-crappy-UI-NdnvAq6a,Citi

Some people say I’m lucky and should just enjoy it but it doesn’t feel right to me. All due to poor leadership, too many organizational changes, and conservative/non-strategic colleagues.  Management doesn’t know how to recruit or develop talent.There’s also limited growth in my role. I don’t think a big increase in TC or promotion is likely at all in the near future. I’m tapped out.Should I? 1. Stay at this job since the pay is not bad (although I’m having second thoughts about this since downloading Blind)  and the stability will be nice if we have another kid. But once that’s done, I’ll be another 1-2 years older and not sure how that will impact job search.2. Look elsewhere but not sure if grass is truly greener at this point.
