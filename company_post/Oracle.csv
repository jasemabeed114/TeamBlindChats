OCI is just focusing on deliveries, high work pressure and no scope of learning and relaxing. I am not able to invest my time with my kids.

I was offered a job at Oracle in the Bellevue area, but I'm not sure if moving there is a good idea.

However, I'm concerned that if things open up, I might immediately have to move to Seattle.My current lease is expiring in July, and if I sign a new lease, it'll likely be for a year. If I'm suddenly called, I might be stuck with paying the rent for the rest of the year in case I'm not able to find someone to take over my lease. My manager isn't responding to emails, but someone under the same manager told me that they have to work with an overseas team, so those meetings will be remote for a while.Any advice will be greatly appreciated.#wfh #newgrad #relocation #returntooffice",3,12,2021-5-15 06:48:08,/post/Confused-about-whether-to-move-for-work-JewqO0dm,Oracle

0,Weird Oracle Interview,hangme,/company/Intel/,nan,"I had an interview with Oracle recently where the position was in US but the person interviewing me was in China. The HR coordinator had briefed me on the details of the role only briefly (and later I learn incorrectly)The interviewer just launched into questions without introductions. She didn’t introduce herself or talk about the role, nor did ahe ask me for an intro.She started off with “Question 1... Tell me about a time..bla bla bla”As I was answering I learned she’s interviewing me for some other position, I clarified that to her and realized that the HR coordinator had messed up. SHE STILL DOESNT TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE ROLE... And continues with her haphazard questions.I literally have to interject and ask her.. “i would love to know more about the product line this role is for and more about your team”OMG!!And the kicker is... I learn then towards the end that she is the hiring manager. Like wtf! Is she a noob?(For a non-tech PM role)",1,11,2021-4-23 03:16:46,/post/Weird-Oracle-Interview-qugEfvwO,Oracle
