Stocks that have done nothing year over year despite the biggest bull market ever. The DJI is clearly a terrible indicator of the economy as a whole, excludes some of the most important stocks, and has only 30 total stocks so no matter what you include it can't possibly be a good representation of anything. On top of that they insist on using the ridiculous measure of price per share which is almost arbitrary at this point.The S&P 500 is nothing to write home about but it's a far superior measure of the broader economy, has more diversity of stocks and sectors, and is rationally weighted. The Nasdaq is arguably better since we have a tech-centric economy. Yet the news outlets all insist on leading with the DJI every time ""the market"" is being discussed and acting like DJI 30k actually meant something.
