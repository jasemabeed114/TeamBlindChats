Cerner's base salary is about $8k higher than OCC's offer adjusted for cost of living (all calculators except smartasset gives this). OCC has a bonus program but Cerner does not. Applying the bonus, both salaries are similar. I don't have a preference of one industry over the other, I feel I would get to learn a lot in both industries. I feel the culture is more relaxed in Cerner but OCC says that there culture is changing. I like Chicago more than Kansas City but am still very confused as to which I should pick.
