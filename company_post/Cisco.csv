0,330% TC bump in 3 years - grateful to this community,monkAtAmzn,/company/Amazon/,Eng,"TL;DR - My TC went from 160K to 688K in 3 years and this is my journey.I am grateful of this community to provide me motivation and help me prepare for my interviews to find the right roles & compensation related to my experience/skills. I want to share my journey to help motivate someone else who is going through similar process.June 2018 TC - 160KOctober 2018 received offer for 220K TC.January 2019 started working with 220K TC.April 2020 received offer for 413K TCJune 2020 started working with 413K TCMay 2021 received offer for 688K TCCurrent Role - Engineering ManagerYoE - 16YoE as manager – 6A friend recommended me to join teamblind in 2018 when I was expecting the offer from Cisco Systems. I interviewed at Facebook and Google and failed both just before Cisco interview. Spending time on blind, I realized how much the expected compensations are at Facebook and Google. Even though I was going to settle for Cisco, I set a goal to join one of them at some point in my career. By reading posts, and receiving some feedback from Facebook and Google recruiters, I realized I failed System Design and Behavioral rounds both. System Design - because I could not show depth and do estimations, and Behavioral, because I didn't have answers in S/TAR format aligning with company cultures. I decided to prepare better for both when I beg next rounds of interviews once the cool-off period was over.Fast forward to December 2019, I faced an M1 interview at FB again. In Jan 2020, I also faced an interview for Amazon L7 Sr. Manager role. I prepared for behavioral rounds by jotting down my Cisco's experience in S/TAR format for various questions. I used Dan Croitor's YouTube channel for the expected questions and writing my responses. For System Design, I prepared using Grokking SD course, and following Gaurav Sen's videos on YouTube. I didn't clear these interviews. Amazon and Facebook didn't provide much feedback so I didn't know what more I had to prepare. I turned again to teamblind to learn about potential gaps and realized that my System Design preparation was too shallow.In March 2020, 3 months after my L7 interview, Amazon reached out again for an L6 role. I must have done well during my L7 interview and potentially got recycled for L6. In April 2020, I faced the virtual onsite due to covid. I did really well per feedback and the offer was extended. After the negotiations, I ended up with 160K base, 225k(y1 sign on), 168k (y2 sign on), 240 RSUs. At 2400$ stock price, it puts my Y1 TC to 413K.I joined Amazon and decided to relocate to Seattle from SF Bay Area. In October 2019, my wife lost her job. She got her H-1B approved in January 2020 but due to covid, all consulates were closed. So, we couldn’t travel to get her visa stamped and she had to give up on the opportunity. This allowed us to be flexible about relocation while her H4 was getting processed. Once my H-1B got approved, I started with Amazon in June 2020. I waited patiently for official announcement about offices to reopen before planning for relocation.In Jan 2021, my wife got another offer and she started working immediately as her H4 EAD was approved. This changed our relocation plan as we now didn’t want to move to Seattle. In March 2021, Facebook recruiter reached out and provided guidance about what should I do for System Design round to be more successful if I face interview again. I decided to reach out to Google recruiter as well and aimed for L7 interview there. I decided to prepare well for System Design rounds this time. I used InfoQ videos, Google SRE book, DDIA book, and System Design Interview YouTube channel for preparation. Combining this with my distributed systems background during IC roles allowed me go in depth for System Designs. I also spent extra time working through Non-Abstract piece of NALSD. Learning about identifying system bottlenecks – CPU, Memory, Disk, Network – and presenting trade-offs were key here. This is where DDIA helped, in addition to SRECon videos. I also spent time reading about stream processing systems. Overall, I spent about 1 month, 2-3 hours on weekdays, 8-9 hours on weekends to improve System Design. For Facebook coding round, I did 20 LC easy, and 10 LC medium – from top 100 Facebook questions, sorted by frequency. I brushed-up my behavioral answers to include Amazon experiences. This time, I recorded some of my answers to time them. I also listened to them multiple times to spot politically incorrect language which was important for Google interviews and revised them.During the last week of April 2021, I faced Google and Facebook interviews. Facebook interview process was seamless and feedback mechanism was prompt. Google process was slow. I had to push recruiter to put L7+ on my interview panel so they could get L7 signals. The recruiter told me that I am interviewing for L7, but by looking at panel members, I realized that they are going to down-level. After the interview with Google for L7, I was submitted for Hiring Committee review and it came back positive for L6(something that I anticipated). By then, I already received offer from Facebook with 240K base/ 1.2m$ worth of RSUs for 4 years/ 20% bonus with 100K sign on. That put me to 688k Y1 TC. And I decided not to pursue Google.Throughout this journey, I referred to teamblind for finding pointers on how to prepare for interviews. I am grateful of all the anonymous members who answered my questions on various posts, and responded to my DMs. The community is strong – and we make it strong. I am continuing to do my part by helping other members. I want to mention that my roles at Cisco, Amazon and now Facebook are more aligning with what I want to work on, rather than just chasing higher TC. I probably would not have entertained Facebook this year if my situation of relocation hadn’t changed.Happy to answer any questions that community has for me !

0,Cisco Public discrimination,YjQx57,/company/Cisco/,nan,"Cisco Systems announced that they will be publicly hiring and promoting more black people. For some reason some random white VP or director that I’ve never talked to somehow benefits me because I’m white. I’m not kidding, they openly lay out their plans to discriminate against all races that aren’t black.Cisco has just also came out with questionable company “beliefs” such as we believe that we should defund the police. Taking away budget that could go to training and body cameras isn’t my believe and neither are other far left beliefs they state. I’ve talked with several employees about this and not many of them find this okay but of course they wouldn’t dare to bring this up internally. Cisco donated 5 million dollars to BLM an organization that spent a portion of their money donating to democrats and a huge portion to travel. There’s no question that they believe in far leftist ideas such as defunding and or abolishing the police, destruction of the nuclear family and abolishing prisons. Not to mention they proudly spout that they are trained Marxist and ironically enough hate capitalism which is basically how Cisco is Cisco. So the biggest issue is they are about to have mass layoffs and didn’t have enough to fund our normal full bonuses and no one got raises. So they can’t take care of employees but they literally can donate 5 million to an anti capitalist Marxist origination. We regularly have company whole meetings where people basically complain about white people and white people are supposed to feel guilty I guess, Ironically enough Cisco gave us the Election Day off hoping that we would vote for someone who authored the crime bill which locked up many non violent black people. Let me not get too off topic though. I used to love working here but I literally have to see politics on social media, sports and on the news, I’d rather it not be crammed down my throat at work. I come to work, not to get lectured on white privileged and racism every single week. Like we are a professional company, I’ve never seen racism at Cisco when at work and I know that we don’t discriminate based on race well until now. Let me come to work and work. Also I don’t believe in some of your far leftist ideas that y’all put out as our beliefs, those aren’t thousands of our beliefs. I’d rather come out as anything except a conservative at work. I feel like we focus more on social issues than building our business. We are a publicly traded company and somehow we are openly saying we are going to discriminate against everyone who’s not black.  I’m not sure how that’s actually legal. I don’t see a future at Cisco because I see that we are investing more in political/social stuff than our employees and growing the business.I still don’t understand how this is legal. You can use google and type In “Cisco social justice beliefs” to see what I’m talking about.Call me a believer but I think telling anyone of a certain race that they can’t do something because of their skin color is the most racist thing you can say. We live in America in 2020. Raising children in single parent households is the biggest form of oppression there can be, you think we highlight that in our SJW beliefs, absolutely not, despite it making children 20x more likely to go to prison, more likely to drop out of HS, more likely to be poor and the list goes on.
