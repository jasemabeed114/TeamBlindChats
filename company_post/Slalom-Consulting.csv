0,Salesforce Consultant/Sr. Consultant @ Slalom Salary,NpnO37,/company/Snowflake/,nan,"Posting for my gf, because her startup is too small to stay anonymous on her account. She's gone through 2 rounds at Slalom so far, but the exact level of what she's interviewing for is still TBD depending on the next few rounds (they reached out to her first to chat and see where she would fit; she didn't apply for a specific job posting with a level listed on it).She's currently an internal Salesforce admin at her company with 6 YOE making 175k/yr, with no prior consulting experience. Given her current salary, she's looking for at least 190k-200k to move elsewhere. Is that even reasonable for those levels at Slalom? Glassdoor and H1B data both show that that's more in line with a solution architect or some sort of principle title at Slalom. She's not sure if she should even continue the process if her salary expectations are completely out of the possibility for a consultant/sr. consultant, unless she somehow magically gets a higher title. #slalom #slalomconsulting #consulting #compensation",0,3,2021-5-4 00:44:33,/post/Salesforce-ConsultantSr-Consultant-@-Slalom-Salary-V8soDqeE,Slalom-Consulting

I'm currently a consultant at FB through Accenture Flex part of their Industry X.0 area. The recruiter was really pleasant and easy to converse with.

Said they are looking to find out from the interviews which positions would be fit my skills and experience. They didn't even ask for my resume just linkedin was fine. That was a first.Any tips on what to expect from the Solution Principal (Security) interview? It's set for 45mins.Any Slalom employees can share their experiences with the SF office?
