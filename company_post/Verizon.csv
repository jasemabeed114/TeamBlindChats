0,Latest in Verizon Voluntary Separation ,VZGal,/company/Verizon/,nan,"For those who follow Verizon, you know that in an effort to transform the company to be more agile for 5G, they offered a voluntary separation offer to ~44K employees, which would give them 3 weeks of pay for every year of service, etc.Perhaps to their surprise, they were hoping for a 10-20% take rate but ended up getting a 30-40% volunteer rate.Some VPs have been telling their teams that they won‚Äôt hold anyone back who wants to leave. Furthermore, the goal was to get most volunteers off the books by the end of the year, with others being asked to stay through Q1 or Q2 of 2019.Employees who were told by their leadership that they would be approved had an incentive to volunteer and start seeking immediate employment to start in January.With a twist, these VPs were recently told they could not backfill anyone (or only a small percentage) whom they approved to leave. However, if someone were to organically depart (via accepting a new job or retiring), they would then be allowed to backfill those positions.With this, employees who they knew were seeking employment or had landed a job externally (as encouraged by their leadership to do) are now going to be denied the separation package. The reason for denial is to allow them to keep their headcount via backfilling these employees who are set to leave on their own accord. This is a very deceptive practice and selfish on the part of these leaders. I hope Verizon reverses their stance as I hate to see my fellow V-Teamers treated in this manner.",9,19,2018-11-24 23:57:15,/post/Latest-in-Verizon-Voluntary-Separation-0BpbzE75,Verizon

This month, it says I used 12.5 GB so far and I don't have anymore data, which is understandable because I had some travel this month. Clearly, I should have additional carry over of 3.7 GB from last month (because my usage says 8.3 GB for last month) on top of 12 GB plan I have.So I called Verizon Support to find out what happened because numbers don't add up for me. Verizon Support took turns between two support rep and finally a manger and none of them could figure out what happened to the carry over I was suppose to get from previous month and just gave away additional 8GB to use until the end of the current billing cycle.I'm almost certain this shit is going to happen again next time I go over my data plan, what do you guys think? :)",5,25,2017-7-28 03:35:11,/post/Hilarious-Verizon-Support-nice-people-though-80v5AWyB,Verizon

Changes for Verizon Media Group have been coming fast in 2018. Earlier this year, CEO Tim Armstrong departed the company, and after the third quarter the group was forced to reevaluate revenue projections for 2020.Oath revenue for the third quarter totaled $1.8 billion, down 6.9% year over year.Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis blamed the decrease on revenue pressure from search and desktop usage, which he said is more than offsetting positive growth in mobile usage and video products, including Verizon‚Äôs distribution partnership with the NFL.‚ÄúBecause search and desktop products make up the majority of the Oath business, and we believe pressure in those sectors is likely to continue, we do not expect to meet our previous target of $10 billion of revenue in 2020. The leadership team at Oath is focused on returning to revenue growth by completing the integration of the legacy AOL and Yahoo advertising platforms by year end, implementing initiatives to realize synergies across all of our media assets, and building services around our core content pillars of sports, news, finance and entertainment,‚Äù Ellis said during the third-quarter earnings call.",3,14,2018-12-20 04:08:42,/post/Verizon-officially-dumps-the-Oath-name-for-its-media-group-CCNmvbyf,Verizon
