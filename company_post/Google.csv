Don't know if I just landed a bad recruiter or if this the norm. Done 9 interviews so far. Yes 9 u read that right. 2 telephone earlier easy peasy. Then the 5 onsites. Most of them I aced and got positive feedback minus 1 of the tech interview went wrong cos the SWE guy asked a coding question which I solved but interview got disqualified. Apparently coding questions not allowed for TPm interviews. So I had to do a retake. Well the retake went sour as well, some miscommunication issue. Final retake 9th tech interview. Went so hard on prepping on real system design questions like CAP theorem, consistent hashing, memcached, web sockets, etc. Was super pumped. Only to get there to be asked more & more behavioral questions. Anybody else had horror tech interview stories for TPM? Why is it hard to find right interviewer for TPM system design interview. Are Google TPMs really hands on and technical. How come no one asked me design whatsapp type questions.Top it off my recruiter never reaches back to me on time which drags it out the more.

My pay is awesome reaching to 400k soon, career projection seems good at least for now. WLB is decent, recently married and planning a baby next year. But I'm pretty much in my comfort zone at work, nearly nothing new to learn in terms of software engineering. Everything in CS circulates around data storage and processing. I spent sometime to learn theoretical physics and computational biology but its useless unless  I do Ph.DRecently, I got offers to do Ph.D in Stanford specializing in Neuroscience / AI, MIT spc' in Applied Mathematics and Harvard spc' in Bioengineering. The pay is only enough to survive alone, sometimes not guaranted but my wife is very willing to support us during my study, she works as a nurse. I always wanted to do Ph.D. Its one of my dreams. If I pursue Ph.D, everything will reset and I will lose a lot of money and my current career projection. The opportunity cost is huge considering 5 years of commitment to research. Besides, I'm not sure if following a career in Academy later on is a good idea. I do not know if its for me until I experience it. I'm not coming back to industry after 5 years as L3/L4 if I find out Ph.D / Academy is not for meOn the other side, such a Ph.D opportunity is rare, specially, the faculty I will work with is the most famous and prestigous in the field.

He mentioned the cloud team has interest on me. Generally I’m also interested in cloud technology but not in first priority. But I’ve seen on blind that the cloud team culture is very different from other teams (in a bad way).Does anyone know is it true that the cloud team is that bad in culture?Should I tell the recruiter that I’m interested in other team as well?

Got a Google L5 offer that is only lukewarm: about 385k with no potential of going higher with stacked refreshers due to the new front loaded vesting schedule. The feedback was to get a competing offer if I want to negotiate more.So now I got an offer for Amazon L6 at about 480k per year. Can Google match/beat this offer for Seattle? What’s the best/top offer I can hope for here?I might also just switch teams and stay at fb if the lowballing continues since I’m making more than either of those offers.Edit: not expecting G or Amazon to match my current tc.

I was rewarded for it, and my TC entering was $900k, a couple years ago.I think I am done with the company now and am looking for something new to learn with a better wlb, and wanted to move to a company that deals with Internet-scale products such as Google.Got a call from the Google recruiter and it was very weird: nothing at all in my experience was discussed, he didn’t even ask for my resume (I have patents on some cloud technologies, I presented at numerous conferences, … not that it matters but it speaks a little bit about the work I’ve done).The interviewer just told me he could loop me in for an L6 SWE with 2 coding interviews on algorithms and 2 system design. I asked if there is some domain-specific interview that can be done, he said no, everyone does the same interview.There is no way in the world I could pass a leetcode interview. I would have to study for many months. I know complexity analysis well and use numerous data structures daily and could certainly tell you when to use a hash table vs ordered map, but not at the level where I could even remotely get a tricky leetcode interview puzzle.At the same time, in the best case an L6 offer would probably be around $500k TC, which is substantially less than my current TC (I am currently at $1M), but I see this as acceptable since probably I’d end up working half hours at Google, Citadel is definitely a grind and I do 70h a week.

0,Why did tech interviews become so hard?,SwAS06,/company/Amazon/,nan,5 years ago tech interviews were mostly LC easy/medium and were somewhat doable.Interviewed with fb and they expected two leetcode medium to be done in 45 mins. Google and Microsoft both asked LC hard and several smaller startups ask LC hard too.Is there too much competition? Too much immigration or supply/demand imbalance?,7,33,2021-5-14 17:29:51,/post/Why-did-tech-interviews-become-so-hard-yMWPcdJ7,Google

0,Leetcode - recursive solutions,MjLb41,/company/BD/,nan,I started working on LC - can do easy ones/medium ones but only in iterative solution fashion. for recursive something throws me off and I can't do it. I'm aware that I need to improve on that specially it saves times during interview also there are problems that can be solved very easily when recursive approach is used. Any tips to improve on that? #leetcode #faang #facebook #google #uber #apple #netflix #amazon,1,22,2021-5-21 09:37:51,/post/Leetcode---recursive-solutions-YuiGK1Zc,Google
