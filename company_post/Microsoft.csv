Not just in terms of exact TC. Here are some questions I am having.1. Google tc is better only by ~6k compared to Microsoft's just after tax. Is it worth it?! Expected a lot more from Google!2. I like my Microsoft team the most. Also the role there is considered at much higher standards compared to the other two. Going into a more research role would, I feel, set me up for a much better life in the long run ( I really like research)3. I tried to get matched to a ML SWE role with Google Brain/Research but couldn't. Can I switch internally IF needed in the future?4. My google recruiter told me I may get ~33% stock refreshers grant after year 1. Is it true? How likely is it?! 5. I don't wanna talk to my amazon recruiter, get that huge ~20k jump and then renege them. Is it worth considering Amazon?! I liked the team and they are made of hyper-smart people.5.

Hiring manager is going above the way to want me and keeps checking in with me. The team is a very new team working in IoT related technologies so very low on-call load.

I fear PiP in Amazon but I had an open discussion with the manager on this and he said you are the last one that should be worried about this. Manager seems way too cool for Amazon standards.

Also no java etc. I know I can change in a year but that means career hit etc. Benefits lot better.Stripe - l4 I know their stock thing. Work seems interesting and good. I am not vest and rest. I like to work a lot. Also payment is a new domain to learn. Benefits are bad. I mean matching 401k health etc.So keeping money aside, I prefer personal happiness over money. Which one is good? I am confused. I liked all people I talked to and team in all three. Hiring Managers were all good and candid.And before you ask. Lowballed hard at Google. FB reject. Ex FB, MS and Amazon. Also on hold from PayPal. I believe I am their second choice. But not interested in paypal now. PayPal was willing to pay around 550k in initial discussion and full remote.

I'm thinking I want to work on distributed systems and learn how to build applications that scale to millions billions+ and grow my career from there. Here's my options:-Microsoft: Mature product with 100s of millions of users. However, a lot of the work is just small features being added here and there. There's an interesting backend side but I'm not sure if I'll be able to work on designing it but rather just maintain and add features.-Series C Unicorn with 100s of millions in funding: My team project is related to the cloud and very visible within the company. Success of the project will highly impact the success of company. The only downside is that pretty much half the team (and 60% of the company) are new grads. Right now the team only has a toy flask app for what the product should be and everyones kinda just figuring stuff out lol.I'm worried that if I join the start up, I may end up contributing to a spaghetti new grad codebase and never really learn proper software engineering practices out of college. This could especially be the case if the start up doesn't take off and instead just vibes for a long time (the market they target is still immature). Furthermore, not having a brand name could make it hard for a career switch. But on the upside, I could work on a project from day 1 which scales to 100s of millions of datapoints and reads/writes and build a strong backend from scratch.the upside of joining Microsoft is that as a new grad I get a lot of experience working on a mature product and learn good SWE practices and also It's a good name to have on my resume. But I don't know how fast I can grow a career just doing app dev, full-stack dev, and expanding existing services the way I would if i worked on a potentially growing highly visible product.any advice would be appreciated!!p.s. using a friends work email to get on blind  #engineering #software #swe #bigtech",2,17,2021-3-25 01:48:34,/post/New-grad-Microsoft-or-Series-C-Unicorn-R04xuuPQ,Microsoft

Meanwhile Group B - for whom I also worked very hard - loves me and my work - and were delighted when I said I wanted to switch. I begged them to keep it hush hush until they were certain, fearing repercussions - and until recently they did.Well, just as I started getting happy hellos from stakeholders in Group B and started to feel certainty is approaching -  Group A appears to have got wind of it. Group A is in good with my manager who has PIPed me for reasons that include begging off judging a student competition for lack of expertise in that functional area and not including two people from group A in my list of people who I was asked to *choose* to comment on my work.My manager told me I was ineligible to move within Microsoft while PIP-ed. Given the ridiculousness of the reasons given - I am fairly certain I will never be found to have 'improved'.My questions (a) Can I do anything about this and be un-PIPed(b) Can I actually wangle a move to the other job while on PIP - is it in anyone else's hands other than my manager's?Edited to add (c) If I resign from MSFT while on PIP, can Group B hire me as a fresh hire as soon as I leave?Thanks",3,11,2021-3-18 10:15:20,/post/Internal-job-moves-while-on-PIP-at-MSFT-CHDSjZPw,Microsoft

0,Why divorce after so many years? (Bill & Melinda),Senoree,/company/Airbnb/,nan,"I come from a culture where the divorce rate is extremely low so I'm genuinely curious and not judging. I get divorcing in the first few years of your marriage due to incompatibility or other reasons. But I don't get divorcing after 27 years together.He's 65 and she's 56 - wouldn't it be easier if they worked on their marriage and spent their older years together?If they can be friends and business partners now (they said they'd still run the foundation together) things aren't that bad between them, there's no abusive situation or cheating going on. Why then would they split? Are they hoping to find love or self-love after the split?*The Microsoft co-founder tweeted that despite “a lot of work on our relationship” the two decided to end their marriage because they “no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives.” * - what does this mean?",24,86,2021-5-4 04:41:01,/post/Why-divorce-after-so-many-years-Bill-Melinda-CS2yXe01,Microsoft
