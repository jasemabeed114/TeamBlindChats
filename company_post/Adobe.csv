0,Adobe Engineering Manager Job + Interview Questions,ach_star,/company/Amazon/,nan,"Hello,10 yoe, TC ~95k (Eastern Europe :) )Saw a few interesting roles at Adobe and I'd like to learn more. The roles are Engineering Manager. Concrete questions:#Interview1) Best way to get an interview? I applied on the website/Linkedin, but saw a bunch of posts on blind with recruiters not following up/managers filling in their own pipeline. Should I DM a hiring manager on Linkedin, or ask someone to refer me? 2) Interview topics for EM? I'm comfortable with the usual Eng Mgr topics (people management, tech design, algos/data structures, roadmaps/prioritization, engineering excellence, etc.). I'm wary whether they will deep dive on Agile topics (e.g. interpret this burndown chart for me) and whether they will deep dive on OOP/design patterns? 3) I have been an engineering manager for a bit more than 3 years in the past, but I am in an IC PM role right now. Is this going to be a problem? I do have the experience of managing a team, hiring/promoting SDEs, creating and delivering on roadmaps, etc., I've just been an IC for the last couple of years.#Life 1) Aiming at an European office. How's the autonomy versus US? In my current company, I've sometimes seen a tight coupling with US offices, with a lot of friction and frustration that comes with it. Are teams mostly autonomous and synchronize at a higher roadmap/product basis, or do they share a codebase/oncall rotation, etc. with the US engineering teams? 2) Particular teams/orgs to go into/stay away from? 3) How easy it is to transfer internally if things don't work out in current team? 4) Any expectations or tips for an Adobe Eng Mgr I may not be aware of or know what to ask? I've been SDM at Amazon in an EU team so that's my frame of reference #adobe",1,0,2021-4-10 06:51:03,/post/Adobe-Engineering-Manager-Job-Interview-Questions-r1mwV485,Adobe

[$138k TC, 3 YoE, Dallas]",WbhH24,nan,nan,"3 YoECurrent TC $80kFT Remote out of DallasI have an 85/15 offer doing post-sales consulting for Adobe - base salary is $120k and remaining 15% [120x.15 = $18,750] for TC of $138k.Originally asked recruiter for base of ""between 120-130"" and thus I've been stuck at $120k base. This is a great offer for me at 50% higher TC [80 --> 120].Because 120 was the number that recruiter + I started off with, this is the same number I shared throughout the 4 rounds of interviews [directly to the HM + 3 other folks]. Will I look like a jackass for saying 120 throughout 4 rounds, then asking for more?Should I even bother negotiating an already good offer?

0,Has anyone went with Adobe over Google for non-tech roles?,hudsonfan,/company/Slalom-Consulting/,nan,"I live in a LCOL city with my fiance and have been wanting to put down roots and start a family. With both roles around roughly $200k~ TC this would be more than enough to accomplish all of my financial goals even with salary progression that only keeps up with inflation ($5m~ total savings at retirement). I really, really did not click with the team I would be joining at Google. I don't want to give too many details as the N of people from Slalom currently interviewing at both Adobe and Google is likely &lt3 if not 1. There are some exciting international elements of this role but I'm wary of how much of it would entail hours long calls in other time zones vs actually traveling there. And again, looking to start a family so not crazy about the prospect of moving every few years with wife and kids or leaving my wife home alone while I travel.I like the people I spoke with at Adobe but am aware of what folks on this app warn about. Toxic politics/culture within Digital Experience (DX), less career growth compared to FAANG, etc. However I've also heard that Adobe has great WLB and they have very low attrition due to people really liking it there. I've also heard there is a big emphasis on enabling internal transfers by the CEO so if things turned out to be a dumpster fire I might have the option of lateraling internally (I have been pursuing a T10 MBA to eventually get to tech product management but would forego for one of the roles).For my next role I'm really looking for a place where I can truly balance personal with professional and minimize how much I have to compromise time and attention on my family as much as possible.Very interested in hearing any thoughts on this. To be clear, verbal offer has been received from Google but nothing from Adobe yet; I completed my final round panel interview and received positive feedback on the call and from the recruiter, but my understanding is they are interviewing 2 other people.Current TC $145k #tech #adobe #google",0,16,2021-5-21 12:42:19,/post/Has-anyone-went-with-Adobe-over-Google-for-non-tech-roles-K0ForHhb,Adobe
