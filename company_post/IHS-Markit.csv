0,Stay away from IHS Markit,ddRi01,/company/Amazon/,nan,"I have very bad experience with this company. I worked in their London HQ full time. Full of shit management that will promote most obedient and those most competent are pushed away. Manager name koutayba, on interview he promised interesting C++ job but turned out it is bug fixing in some in house shitty language nobody heard of. Just on my first week he give me warning that working 8 hours is not enough and showed me that I should be more thankful for working with them. I left after couple of months. Salary is shitty comparing to competitors, no trainings and no experience gained. Overall waste of time.",5,1,2019-8-31 02:27:02,/post/Stay-away-from-IHS-Markit-cuMkaU67,IHS-Markit

0,Apply for additional Amazon role if I’m already interviewing with two teams?,UbyQ01,/company/IHS-Markit/,nan,"Found 4 remote Sr TPM (L6) jobs I was interested in and got a former coworker to refer me to them.  Heard back from two different recruiters in AWS professional services and have phone interviews with each hiring team, one next week, one the following. Today I saw a new job post for TPM (I assume L5) where I currently live in Denver.  Should I also ask for a referral to this new position or wait and see how the others play out? Denver job looks equally interesting to my top pick of the two remote jobs and it would be nice to have an office to go to once we get control of covid, but is less senior (although might be easier to qualify as most of my system design knowledge is theoretical or through eyes of QA/management rather than low level/hands on)?current TC: 160 base plus 40k RSU in unicorn that is several years off from IPO (not IHS Markit), RSUs won’t start to vest until next yearYOE: 18, combo of SQE, QE management, program/project management and 1 yr SDM#amazon #aws",0,2,2020-8-15 16:58:39,/post/Apply-for-additional-Amazon-role-if-Im-already-interviewing-with-two-teams-bmCZG1ig,IHS-Markit
