0,TESLA co-ordinated attack on Index-funds.,VUYz38,/company/Starbucks/,nan,"Don't have the data to prove it but have enough red flags to show that the entire TESLA gang with financial institutions are after public money.Here are some of the points1)  Elon Musk considered (82$) ( before splitting 5 for 1 - 420$) as a fair price point to take Tesla private. Presently it valued at almost 850%  of his own fair point. Most of the surge has taken place with the assumption that Tesla will join the S&P 500 and once it joins, index funds have to include Tesla in their portfolio.2) Ebitda is actually adjusted. Everyone adjusts their Editda figures to complete their story. Instead of accepting the actual financial results, GAAP (Generally adjusted Account principles) give more room to cover the trickery.3) The Majority of profitability in the last four quarters seems to have come from selling the environmental regulatory credits (taxpayers' money).3) Telsa said before Tuesday open that it entered into an equity distribution agreement with a number of Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays, BNP, BofA Securities, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, SG Americas, and Wells Fargo.Why would they need so many banks for equity distribution, seems like make everyone your accomplice so no one could point fingers at you and throw any red flags? Some of these banks have argued against Tesla's valuation in the past and slashed their price targets.4) Today, with 70 % of their equity was raised in 2020 alone. How come a company with profits and free cash flow would need to generate the cash through these offerings. As per their figures, they already have 14$B reserves. Why raise an extra 5B$?5.a) With S&P 500 inclusion, the stress is on index funds to include Tesla in their portfolio. This money will come directly from 401k, retirement accounts of people. The stock pumping has been done so great that most existing investors will need to clear less than 10% of their inventory to profit from existing prices.5.b) S&P 500 inclusion itself is fucked up. By using the market value instead of a more conservative approach like (p/e, profit percentage, cash flow vs valuation, etc...) by just looking at the net positivity of the last four/five quarters and market valuation, every speculative company with some incentive from the government could be in S&P 500. I'm not even in finance but I can see this attack on index-funds, why not anyone has come with a more intelligent way of S&P 500 inclusion? I wonder, Should the S&P 500 focus on maximum gains or maximum valuation?6) Sooner or later when a boom cycle starts, the short-sellers who have been bleeding so far will take out and the index funds have to write their investment off. This might seem far off but in this way, all financial institutions win except for the average 401k investors. The timing and method might be off but this is the only way all financial institutions would win.7) No matter what tesla fans think of, Tesla at the moment is a car company. Tesla is not the Apple version of the cara. Engagement of mobile phones has been increasing and investment in iPhone, mac books could be justified because of the convenience it offers throughout the day in work, personal life. Cars are still solving one problem that is transportation, people will switch to their mobile for entertainment.b. Phones could be offered without insurance, unlike cars.c. Phones are subsidized by Service providers while Tesla might run out of environmental credits.d. Maintenance cost of the iPhone is next to zero while that of Tesla is insurance, battery degradation, parking, etc...e. Apple maintains a monopoly in the market and has seen exponential growth while Tesla after ten years has been at the point of selling hyperinflated stocks every three months so that they could show some profit next quarter.f.  Unlike Apple iOS, tesla does not hold an edge over the battery technology, while motors and cars could be manufactured by almost any operator, the values lie in designing the power electronics and drives which run the motor on battery efficiently. Tesla does not hold a monopoly in self-driving, battery, or power electronics, its only monopoly is cashing out environmental credits and show them as profits.My intent of posting this is to provide other dimensions of thought and calling out a spade. I'm disturbed by the fact that American capitalists are chasing after common people's money. P.S: I do not hold any position in Tesla. I just want to call a spade 'spade'.",15,27,2020-12-8 20:34:18,/post/TESLA-co-ordinated-attack-on-Index-funds-HeaAO2Cj,Credit-Suisse
0,Need Guidance/Mentoring - Transition from Finance (Tech) to FAANG/similar firm,Bwvz31,/company/Credit-Suisse/,Strategy,"Working in Tech Architecture & Strategy at a global financial services company. Graduated with Distinction from Cornell, Masters in Comp Sci. I have been working with Credit Suisse NY for 9 years now, and did not consider moving as I liked my team, manager, WLB and my role. Currently working as an individual contributor, but have managed a small team before (I am a VP, managed few AVPs and Analysts).Only recently realized (less than a year back) that my total comp (~$175K) is ridiculously low when compared to FAANG/ tech firms (thanks blind/levelsfyi). Some of it is due to staying in the same team for 7+ years, but I know many friends/peers in other financial services organizations who are in the same ball park as me (~200K total comp for VP). I have received calls from several banking/consulting (Big 4) firms, but their comp was is in the same range as mine.I am therefore thinking of moving industries, and going to core tech. I would be lying if $$ was not the primary motivator, but also realized that financial services is ever shrinking - constant cost cutting, stock price is continuously declining or stagnant, 80%+ funding is for regulatory projects that have very little to do with business and tech innovation, legacy tech stack.I am not sure how to even begin this transition. I am not a developer, and have not coded in 5+ years now. All all my content knowledge is business specific - investment banking and private banking product knowledge. Most of my work is creating target operating models, building business cases, evaluating technology platforms, creating strategy decks for CXOs - I mostly stay in excel and powerpoint land. I am not sure if there a parallel for this role in the tech industry. The closest I have identified is a Technical Program Manager . I am not a Software Engineer, or even a Product Manager. I have many many friends from Cornell, other top universities who transitioned to Tech, but almost all of them were developers, and did this move early in their career (2-3 years in).Spoke to few friends, and finally got a call from Amazon for Senior TPM role. Managed to clear phone screens, and get to the onsite. Unfortunately I was rejected, reason given was technical skills - cleared the LPs, program management, communication hurdles - but don't have the right  tech chops. I had extensively prepared for system design, but I guess never really got down into the nitty gritties of what Amazon was expecting from a SD interview. I guess I cannot apply to Amazon again for at min 6 months now.I was hoping to reach out to this group and get some guidance on how I can crack into the Tech world.  Anyone here who has a profile similar to mine, and managed to make the transition - would love to hear from you. Any recommendations on which firms to target, which roles to target in these firms, who is now hiring, how to prepare for these -  would be sincerely appreciated. Also if there are folks in financial services industry who disagree with my comments/assumptions above, would love to hear more....#financetotech",5,4,2020-7-17 23:21:59,/post/Need-GuidanceMentoring---Transition-from-Finance-Tech-to-FAANGsimilar-firm-CEaD6kch,Credit-Suisse
