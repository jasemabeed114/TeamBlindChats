0,My Dad is looking for a late career switch... eng help a sales guy out,CfHJ23,/company/Yext/,nan,"Hey All! Hopefully you brillant engineers can help. Im in sales and half the $hit you all talk about makes no sense to me recruting wise.My Dad is 60, been in computer engineering for 30+ years mostly in C++. Mostly legacy companies (Boeing, Siemens, etc). Heâ€™s planning to work for another decade before retiring (when mymom turns 65 so they can avoid paying for healthcare). His newer management has outsourced most of his teams work overseas and he now just has to sit back and fix the errors, rather than writing the code himself. Not what he signed up for, or what heâ€™s really interested in.Ask: If he begins looking for a new role, what languages does he nees to be profiecient in? Any recommendations for training/ learning material?Obviously his age is against him but with 10 years left, he should still have plenty left in the tank. Heâ€™s actually pretty excited for a fresh start.Heâ€™s in St. Louis, and is open to office work in the area or remote work. He works remote fulltime currently.Thanks in advance.",2,5,2020-2-17 16:24:51,/post/My-Dad-is-looking-for-a-late-career-switch-eng-help-a-sales-guy-out-kcdmzVDX,Siemens
