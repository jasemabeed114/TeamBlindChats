0,MasterCard Australia - Worst company in Australia and please avoid,orWH44,/company/Accenture/,nan,"All,I wanted to share my experience of working at MasterCard, Australia. The experience is one of the worst  i ever had in my career.Many good engineers and leads, left the teams here in Sydney recently, because of highly inefficient, incompetent and unethical senior leadership.The old timers and teams here came through acquisition of small companies like pinpoint, data cash etc.  Along with them, they bought in the culture. Old timers here brazenly lie, falsify data, plagiarise the other's work and fulfil their yearly goals. Their only goal is to save them selves.People who have no experience with software development, were made as vice president here. These old timers have occupied positions, work as private mafia. Their only goal is to project false data, bully, threaten and abuse engineers. I have seen office politics, but here its a different league of abuse altogether of engineers.They hire engineers who can tow their line and fulfil their yearly goals. These old timers have no skills whatsoever. Worst is that the leadership here  lies through their teeth.Brazen manipulation is rampant here. The kind of unethical practices performed here are unprecedented. For years, the leadership creates projects, which has no substance to the organisation. The coterie of these old timers help each other to grow up the ladder. The so called architects with 20 years experience has no software development experience at all. Their job is to throw features to the engineers, and when engineers architect and finish the feature themselves, the old timers project the features and the deliverables as their own. People from sales are promoted as architects, product managers. The architect cant even differentiate between class and interface.In the name of agile development, features were grossly underestimated, engineers were threatened to design, later hand over the design document to architect. The VP, product manager and architect will present as their own. The VP brazenly threatens to hire from a given vendor even though cost of hiring is high. The candidates were hired literally as slaves, and threatened with action. False bills were floated to obfuscate to the senior leadership in US.They ruined a products with lack of skills and incompetence. Engineers are guinea pigs here. Any reasoning to question or change will be threatened with action. If you care for your career, health and peace, please don't join MasterCard in Australia. Also, please don't trust the glassdoor reviews for this company, esp for Australia. They are mainly fake and genuine reviews are suppressed. Mastercard is an engaged employer with glassdoor, so your reviews as is wont show up on portal. #tech #mastercard #visa #recruiting #hiring #amex #tech #deloitte #macquarie #jobs #culture #pwc",14,8,2020-7-27 09:31:45,/post/MasterCard-Australia---Worst-company-in-Australia-and-please-avoid-VkxANSYZ,Mastercard

As of April, DoorDash now also offers a free benefit for dashpass for MasterCard holders too. The geniuses over at DoorDash never considered that Chase Freedom is also a Mastercard now and didn't bother to test this out. So if you have a Chase Freedom mastercard neither promotion will work correctly in DoorDash and will break your current dashpass subscription with no (current) way to fix this. Time to ditch this app I suppose :)Yes, also talked to both Chase and DoorDash support, but they just run off a script and have no idea wtf to do to fix it.

(wfh is gooood too!)2) What are some OTHER roles that might be worth switching to, given my current job role? I'm ready to do some preparation but seriously can do with some guidance from someone.3) Based on my current understanding - Data Science and Analyst roles in Investment Banks (GS / JPMC) might be worth doing some preparation for -  (a) thoughts of people who've made the switch to DS from Analyst roles? (b) Any idea whether CFA L1/2 helps in this regard - to make a switch to IB?  4) People in these roles at GS / JPMC - what are your thoughts on the strategy to prepare for analyst & similar roles? 5) Not making a switch, and working hard at the job can get me to L7 in about 2~2.5 years - similar to what an MBA freshie gets - which is I guess, better than going for an MBA now.

Furthermore, my sister told that we would only live together for one year, and then she would move back to the Columbia dorms. Should I:1) Live with my sister in Morningside Heights for free; commute 30 minutes to the office2) Get a studio in Flatiron for $2300/month; commute 5 minutes to the office3) Get back together with my ex-girlfriend and share an apartment with her for $2500/month; commute 5 minutes to the office4) Continue frantically searching for a new roommate to share an apartment with for $1300/month; commute 10-20 minutes to the officeMy YOE is 0 and my TC is $125K, which of these options would you recommend?Thanks!! #rent #housing #mastercard #nyc #roomster",0,11,2021-2-20 23:04:24,/post/Best-Place-to-live-in-NYC🗽🧧🇳🇨-Xn7CkvVc,Mastercard

I was told that my performance was not upto the mark and that I had to resign immediately with no severance.I asked my manager, to give examples of instances where I did not perform well, and he could not name a single instance. I even mentioned that I had received the highest rating in my last appraisal, and I did not hear about any concern about my performance at that time. But they were not willing to listen to that.I asked them, why they were not putting me on PIP, they did not give any reason.I asked to move to a different team, but they refused giving no reason.Then I asked for a 3-4 months of leeway, so that I can atleast try to find other employment. They did not respond to this request.Then they ended the call and immediately blocked my LAN/official email.Meanwhile, they also stopped my salary without any intimation or explanation.After that, every few weeks someone from the HR team reaches out to me either on phone or emails me on personal mail asking me to send them a resignation email. When I ask them to give me 3-4 months of extension and ask them the reason for stopping my salary, they stop responding.Every few week, someone from HR reaches out asking me to Physically come to office for some so called “discussions”, but they refuse to do so over phone or email.Neither haver I sent them any resignation letter or have they sent me any termination letter. I still haven’t received any salary since then.I even crosschecked my employment contract, and realised that it does not contain any resignation or termination clause. Maybe that’s why they haven’t sent any termination letter yet.Once I find another job, I will formally resign and take legal action against them.

0,Need some Help!,fcfk80,nan,Consultant,"I'm about to graduate from undergrad and begin full-time as an Associate Product Manager at a Fintech company (think Visa, Mastercard, Amex).It's been really cool seeing people here say that the guidance they received from this forum has helped them land PM positions at FAANG companies.I'm a dumb, almost-recent graduate, and I was wondering if people on this forum could offer me this same guidance on potential career paths to eventually move to a PM role at a FAANG company.I know these roles are hyper-competitive, as I was steamrolled when recruiting for an APM position at one of these companies. Nevertheless, I was able to secure an APM position at a sudo-tech companies, and I have heard that it is somewhat easier to secure an experienced PM role at a FAANG company with PM experience than to get into their APM programs.If people on here could offer me some tips or recommendations on how to eventually move from my current company to a FAANG as a PM, that would be exceptional and I would be incredibly grateful.Thank you so much!!!  #productmanagement",1,0,2020-11-16 22:31:11,/post/Need-some-Help-Up0EzCJ8,Mastercard
0,Job Interviews ,BlackGirl,/company/Cisco/,nan,"Hi,I have interviews with Facebook-RPM, Apple, Robinhood, Microsoft and MasterCard coming up over the next few weeks.I am mentally burnt out from my job. I am about a year and 2 months plus at Cisco.I really want to quit my job and focus on my interviews because I believe I will walk away with one offer from any of the companies.I can’t read because I’m so stressed, unhappy and very depressed with my job. I am completely overwhelmed. I work at least 60-70hours a week. I am unable to take time off work because two people on my team are on PTO until next week.My job has been a major source of depression for me since Covid happened. I am expected to work longer hours. My manager keeps piling more and more project on me with unrealistic expectations.My role is a very unique one as I report directly to C level executives.Facebook interview is this week and I am freaking out.I have the option of quitting my job this week and moving all my interviews two weeks out.That way I get enough time to prepare? Because time off is not possible in the next two weeks unless I am dead.The fact that I am getting so many interview opportunities during a pandemic is not lost on me. I do at least 10 applications a day after work. I reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn. Many of them ghosted me but a few replied and were willing to give me an opportunity. I didn’t get any referrals. This is all cold calling.I am working so hard to leave this job. And now that I’m close to the end, I can’t even study for interviews. I need about a week to prepare for my interviews. I have three deliverables this week. I spent all Saturday working.Please offer suggestions on what I can do? Should I just walk away and take care of my mental health first before preparing? I have enough savings to cover me about 5-6 months plus Tesla stock I can sell. I bought 10 units in January and it has grown so much.TC: $125kYOE: 1.2",5,7,2020-9-6 13:42:01,/post/Job-Interviews-gh5iCC41,Mastercard
