0,Looking for R&D Roles in HCI,uijuH45,/company/Infor/,nan,"Hi ! I am posting this from my friend's profile as Blind doesn't support school emails yet.I am a doctoral candidate working in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) specializing in AR/VR, Spatial Interactions, Spatial UI/UX, Haptics, and Human Subjects Research from the perspective of Computer-Aided Design and 3D Modeling. While my primary field is HCI, my degree will be in Mechanical Engineering due to the design context. For the past one year, I have been desperately looking for relevant roles across established and startup companies that allows me to work in the capacity of a researcher, research scientist, applied scientist and similar R&D roles. However, more often that not, I am overlooked by most companies or misunderstood due to my degree in Mechanical Engineering and not Computer Science. However, PhD is more about work relevance than the degree itself. It'll be really helpful if anyone here can advise/guide/refer me on how to overcome this bias towards CSE and have companies focus more on work relevance. Also, if there are any roles that you or your acquaintances are aware of, and I can help contribute to.

0,7 months of unemployment to FAANG,IntelTME19,/company/Intel/,Eng,"Hi Blind Community,I wanted to share my long and brutal road from layoff to FAANG company. I hope to give some inspiration to others who are unemployed or getting rejected. When it seems all hope seems lost, remember someone has been there as well. If they can do it, so can you!I have 15 YEO, 5 as developer and 10 as technical marketing role. I have a BS and MS in computer science from a top 10 USA university. My resume is solid and recruiters have told me.I worked for Intel for 10 years and I technical program manager in my last role. I was very good at my job and I loved it! I would have been totally happy if I retired in that Intel job. I loved my team and my manager. The pay was low but I was very happy. See my Intel TC below.Unfortunately, a vengeful senior VP within Intel IAGS cut my entire group in March 2020 and then hired one of his good old boys to do the same job. We got on his shit list because we started reporting some of his unethical spending to finance and it got back to him. This is actually illegal and some encouraged me to sue. But it's not worth my time and the return would be minimal. Also, that evil VP would still be there. We were even given roles on others teams but the VP blacklisted everyone on my team and blocked all transfers. I was forced to take the separation package, which was about 40K after tax. I'm still bitter about this VP, I wish nothing but failure in his life. I left in March 2020, when covid19 was extreme. We even begged to get extended but was rejected!!From March 2020 - August 2020, I applied to near 150 jobs online. I applied to any tech company, big and small. I failed big companies like Amazon, Spacex, Autodesk, Google, Facebook and even Intel again. Rejection was extremely brutal and demoralizing. Covid19 has made competition extreme. I remember applying to a Microsoft job and saw that LinkedIn alone had 2000 applicants. How in the world can I set myself apart when there are thousand of qualified people!?? But I forced myself to apply to a new job every day. Getting excited and then sad from rejection was an exhausting emotional roller coaster. I assumed I would eventually land some low end job.Then one day in August 2020, a random recruiter from FAANG emailed on LinkedIn. It was one of my dream companies and I never truly considered I was good enough. At this point, I thought it was fake. I had been scammed before from fake jobs. But this time, it was real!After going through 5 rounds and interviewing with 10 people, I got a job offer!! I was over the moon. I'm now working on a project that will literally change the world in the coming years.For all those looking for jobs, I send you all the luck and best wishes. No matter how much you fail, please keep trying. Sometimes life test you and you must endure. If you can get through it, you shall be rewarded.Lean on your family for support and be thankful for their good health.Intel base: 115KIntel Bonus: 25KIntel RSU: 10KIntel TC: 150KNew FAANG Base: 190KNew FAANG RSU: 160K over 4 years New FAANG Sign On: 75KNew FAANG TC: 305K #covid #laidoff #intel #faang #covid19 #layoff",959,306,2020-11-13 17:53:24,/post/7-months-of-unemployment-to-FAANG-4VYDJqRb,Autodesk
0,Should I join a post Series B startup,nBno00,nan,nan,"I have three offersDropbox, SF - TC ~450K as an EMAutoDesk, SF - TC ~230K as an EMStartup, LA - TC ~180K  (plus 100K equity/year) as a Dir of Eng.Now I am mostly lingering between Dropbox or the start up. Even though the start up is paying less cash their equity is pretty decent with a good upside if they have a good exit. Now this is where I am a new bee in terms of start up maturity levels. So I did some research and below is what I know about this start up and I need some guidance from people who are working with start ups. For extreme anonymity reasons (a bit ironic though) I'm not naming the startup.About the start upThey are an E-Commerce company competing with Amazon, Walmart and Costco within a niche vertical.Year 1 - Self funded and kicked off the companyYear 2 - Raised $7.5M in Series A with $50M in Sales.Year 3 - Raised $120M Series B, with a valuation of $600M, sales at $100MYear 4 - Sales around $150 to $200MYear 5 - Sales at $200MYear 6 is 2019Burn rate is ~$20M/year.When asked if when they are planning to raise a Series C they said that they are not looking to raise a new round at least for the next 2-3 years. Overall, as I am trying to dissect this it feels like a pretty matured growth company that could have a decent exit in the next 3 years. However they are not profitable and are planning to be profitable by 2020.Worst case I will be left stranded with their equity which may not mean anything unless they have a good exit.Their team on paper and track record looks solid and their offer matches with my current base.What do you think? Any guidance or suggestion would be very helpful. Thanks in advance.",5,20,2019-3-4 04:44:03,/post/Should-I-join-a-post-Series-B-startup-Q70CeCB0,Autodesk
