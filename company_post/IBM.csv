0,IBM/SAP has the hardest interview,jaff.bezos,/company/Amazon/,nan,"I was never able to get an offer from IBM. One time, I went onsite directly through an internal referral and got absolutely destroyed by the snobbish interviewer. Second time, I failed the online IQ test so never heard back. Damn, that IQ test felt harder than LC hard because you cannot even prepare.Similar experiences with SAP. I interviewed there 3 times. Questions were about specific technologies in Java, Ruby, etc. as well as behavioral. Behavioral questions were like how do you handle a difficult teammate. I provided answers based on real experiences. I got rejected twice and ghosted once.I used to feel super bad for getting rejected by IBM and SAP. I was dreaming about working there. It is a status symbol in my friend circle from a noname state school. Business administration major girls will swallow if you are from IBM!Where as, after doing 400-500 LC, I can comfortably solve most all LC medium and a fraction of well known LC hard.

0,IBM - Hybrid Cloud,Deyo,nan,nan,"Hello,is there anyone that works in the hybrid cloud/red-hat department at IBM. IBM is clearly working on gaining market share in the cloud wars with AWS, azure and Google cloud having a large market share. I work with a consulting firm called Thechumeffect.com that links the African market to the rest of the world and there is a large untapped market in that sector. You see a lot of industries are scared to migrate fully to the cloud because of the public cloud but now with the hybrid cloud and having on-site premises and off-site premises we are working on customizing a solution and a pathway on how IBM can actually gain a foothold in that market and gain an advantage. AWS is winning the war because of brand positioning not because their technology is better the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of cloud is AWS and that is because on things like YouTube they have come up with tutorial for first time developers to learn how to use the cloud with AWS, they also partner with a lot of venture capital firms to position themselves as a choice for these startups, please what are your thoughts, would love to grab a virtual coffee ? with someone that is in that hybrid/red-hat department.#Hybridcloud #IBM #gotomarket #tech",2,7,2020-12-29 01:47:45,/post/IBM---Hybrid-Cloud-qLSctL7o,IBM

0,Went from IBM to MSFT and it's much worse,kima,/company/IBM/,nan,"Usually the perception is that Microsoft is obviously better than IBM, but I'm shocked to see that it fucking sucks. Maybe I went from one of the better orgs in IBM to a dysfunctional org in Microsoft.Anyway, here are the reasons:1. Most code doesn't have a readme. Tribal knowledge and reading the code is the only way to figure out what's going on. 2. Very few design docs. All architecture knowledge is rehashed every 6 months by someone new in a ""brown bag"" or ""FHL"" call. If only you wrote down and maintained what you're talking about, you wouldn't waste everyone's time just to re-explain the basic architecture.4. Too much knowledge on OneNote. OneNote sucks because there is no version history. Impossible to know what is new and what is stale. People hesitate to remove things because deleting content is permanent.5. No culture of repo ownership. A lot of critical code doesn't have a clear owner and the history is littered with random people making 2 line changes as they need. Deps go stale. Unit tests go stale. Even very senior engineers are assigned small tasks in various repos instead of total ownership of one area.7. (Most surprising:) WLB is B.A.D. People regularly work 8am to 7pm. Low-trust culture: if people take a lunch break they post on the team channel. If people take 30min off they apologize for it. Maybe you folks aren't used to a remote-first culture but the whole point of working remotely is so that you aren't glued to your chair and have the freedom to intersperse household work with office work.8. Weird concept of managership. First line managers are just Principal Engineers who also play the role of scrum master. Often they are the most proficient engineer on the team and continue pushing code as if they're IC. You people don't understand that manager is a totally different skillset that involves relationship building with the team, maintaining morale and motivation, growing talent and other soft skills functions. If a manager needs to touch code then they have trouble delegating.The talent quality is good overall but it's stuck in a dysfunctional context. I just feel bad for the lifers who have never seen better because their view of the profession is probably very grim.",15,23,2021-3-27 13:25:15,/post/Went-from-IBM-to-MSFT-and-its-much-worse-t5F7pMbZ,IBM

Before interning at IBM, I have worked as an intern at a finTech firm as a web developer for a year and also worked at a known Media company for a few months as a Developer Intern. This is a little bit of my background.The offer that I received from IBM is $95k yearly plus a $10k signing bonus which seems like an average in NYC location for new grads at IBM. However, since I have been already working with IBM for 7 months and had prior industry experience through my internships, I really believe that I should start a small negotiation to get my yearly salary to at least around $100k, considering the current living cost in NYC. What tips would you guys recommend me to start a negotiation before I sign my offer letter? Any suggestions will be highly appreciated.

Do it with paycut?,HmfD13,/company/IBM/,nan,"Hi everyone,I've been at IBM for a bit now s my only first/big job and I got a compelling offer from a startup (100 mil funded, started 5 years ago, Series B) in an industry that I always wanted to get into with a title bump (Principal level... aka I'll be the first of my role in that company). The team in IBM isn't that great but the company itself has treated me very well so far. However, my growth (as well as estimating my potential growth) and the team dynamic has been really eating away at me.The startup is offering me to create a new line of products that will be part of their core business model and I'm excited by it (and the fact that I will be in the industry that the startup is in). I'm fairly confident that I will be able to deliver and learn a ton of new things in an industry that I am fairly new to. Another aspect I thought of, is working in a different environment with arguably smarter people as IBM was my first/big job.I'd also have to cancel a purchase on a house and move from Austin to DMV (DC/Maryland/Virginia) area. Fortunately, no debt and a US Citizen.I'm in the upper range of 20s and I thought if this is the time to take risk, this is one of my last chances to join a startup. Should I suck it up and stay at IBM and try to move teams / work things out?Startup: 180K Base + Options (0.05-0.075% stake). Relocation included. Likely to get Security Clearance.
