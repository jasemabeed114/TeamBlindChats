0,1. Net Investment Income Tax 2. Installment payments,MarsBound,/company/Facebook/,nan,"1. Just got my 2020 tax return from my accountant and there is an item for tax from form 8960, Net Investment Income Tax. It looks like essentially 3.8% of my entire income (salary plus investments) over $200k.I made $176k salary and $118k investments for a total of $294k, so the tax on $94k was $3.6k. ($94k was less than $118k).From cursory research this seems like a double tax on investment income to pay for medicare. I'm expecting to have substantially greater investment income in 2021 - will I really need to pay an extra 3.8% on all of it? Is there a cap? It feels like I'm being penalized for earning money through (short term) investments instead of salary, what is the justification for this?2. I didn't make any estimated payments in 2020 (didn't know about them), even though I made capital gains. I was expecting to owe a penalty due to not making any but there doesn't seem to be any indication of that on my tax return. Is there a reason for this?3. Since I made no estimated payments, I now owe $45k in taxes. I can easily afford this but I was presented the option to pay in installments over 72 months, with 3% interest. Since I can make way more than 3% interest by deploying the capital in investments, this seems like a fantastic deal.

0,Made $$$ investing/trading bitcoin. Quit my job?,qzUX57,nan,nan,"Hi all,I've been invested in Bitcoin since 2015 when I was a student at university. Currently working in Infosec at a Big 4 consulting company in Europe. Gross salary is approximately €46,000.Through investing and trading cryptocurrency derivatives (background in Econ + Finance) I've amassed around $3.5 million. After the previous crypto market cycle in 2017/2018 I used some of the proceeds to purchase a house (with cash). My total net worth is currently around $4.2 million.I've only reached this number through a lot risk-taking and I'm considering ways to divest into harder assets to combat inflation, reduce the volatility of my portfolio and generate stable cashflows.As far as my day job, it's pretty good all things considered, however the growth potential (financially) is limited unless you're shooting for Partner (which I'm not).Operational roles (i.e. doing the technical work) appear undervalued to me in comparison to managerial/less technical roles. Further, these operational roles demand significant time spent researching and staying up to date with the latest techniques and methodologies.In the long run, I don't feel it's the best use of time because years from now most of these techniques and methodologies will be be outdated anyway. Also, the older I get, the less willing and able I will be to keep up and/or compete with younger talent.I would rather spend my time doing other things - e.g. managing investments, trading, reading books, travelling etc. I've also considered setting up a business (unrelated to technology or cryptocurrencies) for personal fulfilment and community contribution.I realise ""quitting your day job to start trading full time"" is rarely good advice, though I've had a degree of success (a lot of luck too) and feel that I have enough capital to divest and produce stable cashflow to ""insure"" myself against the event of ""blowing up"" my trading account.I suppose I'm not looking to ""stop working"" and just sit on a beach for the rest of my life - there are so many unforeseen expenses ahead of me. I would however like to be in control of my time.At the end of the day, I'm taking on risk in the markets that far outweigh my compensation at work. Staying employed is a ""hedge"", but if I'm able to create and maintain cashflows that exceed what I can expect in salary even after several promotions - perhaps I have enough to quit?It seems logically incongruent to me, to spend my attention 9-5 at a job where I receive perhaps €100 net for the day, whilst I'm maintaining trade positions that are many multiples of my annual salary. Of course the risk/reward profile is different, so they're not directly comparable.I guess the question is, given the context/background - what would you do?Age: 29YOE: 3NW: $4.2 m",8,9,2021-3-16 10:35:12,/post/Made-investingtrading-bitcoin-Quit-my-job-sWW0Ndwu,Capital-One

That means I'm paying 33k+ extra tax due to Long-term capital-gains income of 108k, which is a tax-rate of 33/108 = 30%+ on just capital-gains.First-time paying this high amount of taxes. I've heard long-term capital gains taxed only at ~15% unlike short-term at 35%, but this shows 30% long-term capital gains tax.Is this sort of overall tax of ~40% usual, or is there some obvious mistake or in the above taxes that look high? Doesn't that tax-rate of 30% on just the capital-gains (long-term) of 108k look incorrect?  #tax #irs #cpa",4,19,2021-5-10 06:41:56,/post/33K-extra-in-taxes-on-capital-gains-TsJQdsFx,Capital-One

0,Capital One SWE offer and questions,Jumbo2018,/company/Cerner/,nan,"Recently got an offer from Capital One in McLean, VA for the Senior Associate Software Engineer position.Base: 118kSigning bonus: 10kRelocation: 141 credits (apparently around a 15k cash value according to recruiter)YOE: 2.5 yearsIt seems like a pretty decent offer to me - much better than my current TC of only 72k at least (albeit in a very low COL area). I had a pretty good conversation with the hiring manager I would be working under and he seemed like a great guy to work with. The work they are doing seems to have good visibility and most importantly, the tech stack is pretty solid and all the technologies they are using are stuff I really want to work with. Overall I’m quite happy with the offer and team, but I have been seeing a lot of mixed reviews about Capital One here so just wanted to get an honest opinion on what it is actually like to work over there. I guess the experience varies greatly depending on which team you’re put on (just like at any other company), but what are some major pros and cons that would be common for most employees? Stack ranking seems to be something that nobody is happy about, but my current company does the same so I’m quite used to it. Any other major cons that I need to be aware of? How is the work-life balance for SWEs in most teams? Also, what is it like to live in McLean, and what are some decent areas to find an apartment in? I’ve been doing some digging and it seems like most 1 bedroom apartments close to the office have rent starting from $1500. I’m fine with that but any possibility of finding something decent for less than that if I choose to live a bit further from the office? Another question I had was regarding the CIP cash bonus mentioned in my offer letter. It says that the bonus would be 5.5k for performance that meets expectations, and would go up to a maximum of 11k based on performance. How much do people generally tend to get for the bonus? For performance above average, what are the chances of getting something higher than 5.5k? And are there instances when people get lower than 5.5k?Would appreciate some insights, especially from people working there as SWEs.
