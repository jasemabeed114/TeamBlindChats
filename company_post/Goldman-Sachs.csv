0,Goldman Sachs Bonus Question ,8j33l,/company/AlphaSights/,Eng,I have received an offer from Goldman Sachs for software engineer position and the recruiter promised  me 75K bonus. Only base salary is mentioned in the official offer letter. I am skeptical to sign the offer letter. Does the 75K bonus stays every year as long as I meet expectations? Did the bonus decrease or increase for anyone? Can you please share your experience around bonus part of your compensation?

0,Layoffs after paternity/maternity leave at Goldman Sachs,gseses,/company/Goldman-Sachs/,nan,"I wanted to keep this quiet for obvious reasons but I feel that it must be disclosed given the lack of respect, compassion and honesty Goldman Sachs has for their employees. In 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, two VPs who had their maternity/paternity during the same year were fired from the firm, both of them worked in the same sub-team within the same division. Taking their paternity leave may not have been the reason they were fired. Yet, what is one to conclude of two VPs in the same team getting fired at the same time after they had come back from their paternity leave during the same year and fired consequently during a pandemic? This while GS revenues were better than ever and even more painful to watch given the firm had had said that no layoffs were going to happen in 2020. I find it hard to believe that the cost savings the firm saved by firing these two people were bigger than the morale and optics of such event, specially during such rough times and in the middle of a economic/health crisis. Management at this bank lacks basic human ethics, honesty and compassion for their fellow human beings. #Thinkbeyondrevenue #finance #goldmansachs #jpmorgan #chase #blackrock #stockmarket #wellsfargo #morganstanley #bankofamerica",139,83,2021-3-11 04:20:54,/post/Layoffs-after-paternitymaternity-leave-at-Goldman-Sachs-4ZJtxG6K,Goldman-Sachs

Here are some of my questions:1. Is it true that Goldman does not give commitment for bonus in writing?2. How is the overall compensation for next year calculated at Goldman? Do they look at the current comp (base and bonus from the first year) and use those numbers to determine comp for the next year or is it a possibility that the next year comp could be lower than the first year and that the guarantees for first year mean nothing for the next year?3. Is it common for folks who join Goldman to see their overall comp to drop in the second year since they no longer have the ""guaranteed bonus"" they negotiated for the first year?Thanks!#goldmansachs #offer #bonus#engineering #software #swe",4,36,2020-8-23 02:15:41,/post/goldman-offer-related-questions-bt4m2pE3,Goldman-Sachs

Any idea how long it usually takes to communicate the outcome?Update: Got a rejection mail couple of days ago and had asked for a feedback. My coding round didn't go well, probably that is reason for the rejection. I had asked the HR before the interview about the expectation on the coding side, but there was no concrete answer. But the HR did mention that it is not a developer role (good to have developer skills not required). The interviewers were much younger to me, in analyst and senior analyst roles. I can see a pattern that from my past experience, that whenever an younger professional is interviewing me the result was always against me. Whereas the senior professionals were more accommodating and understanding about the value I can add.I had a similar experience with Amazon (Applied scientist) in the past (coding was the main drawback). I have never coded professionally in the past and the only time I had to code was to perform certain simulations. Coming to my background, I have a PhD in math (probability), bachelors and masters in statistics and a postdoc experience of about 4 years in math physics (read probability) with a good publications.
