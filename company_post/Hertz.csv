0,No room for loyalty in business.,isaidit ,/company/Indeed/,nan,Hertz paid more than $16M in “retention” bonuses to its executives before filing for bankruptcy and a month before laying off its employees. (I bet those bonuses were legally guaranteed in some way for those execs like they never are for the average employee.) Then went to courts to ask permission not to pay its laid-off employees severance in the middle of a global pandemic when millions are unemployed.This is the kind of news and action against employees that comes to mind when people are critical of those who are not loyal to companies.https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-hertz-bankrupcy-layoffs-coronavirus-retention-bonuses-16-million-20200527-xpaewi4htvfabhn5qmeeqgwzx4-story.html,6,4,2020-5-27 03:41:07,/post/No-room-for-loyalty-in-business-HzxPQcEP,Hertz
