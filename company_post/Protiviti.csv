0,Considering move to Consulting,YYMT27,/company/JPMorgan/,Finance,"Would greatly appreciate some feedback from those already in the industry. I'm currently interviewing with a number of firms, Protiviti, Promontory, and McKinsey to name a few and each appear to have their pros/cons. The most interesting to me is Promontory, which is a part of IBM. I have been in financial services for almost 15+ years and, frankly, my pay isn't what it should be. The primary reasons for me making the move are 1) comp and 2) a passion for a career in risk/compliance that's more impactful than what I've done so far.To that end, the majority of posts/news articles that I've seen about IBM are negative. They're far behind competitors when it comes to their cloud offering, they apparently have a bloated workforce that they've continued to trim over the years, and they have recently appointed a new CEO. I'm very much interested in making the move, but am concerned that given the pandemic and IBM's unique challenges, I could very well be out on the street in a year or two.Does anyone have any advice or perhaps even experience with Promontory/IBM in particular that could provide some insightful feedback? #consulting",0,34,2020-7-20 13:48:24,/post/Considering-move-to-Consulting-jUpojqy8,Protiviti
