0,Informatica - Beware,guile,/company/Cisco/,nan,"If possible avoid informatica, I had very bad experience with them, same now happened to my friend.There is a principal recruiter who don’t know how to talk, very rude , someone already mentioned his name on glassdoorScenario 1 : Completed telephonic and 6 onsite interview loop, after that this recruiter called and informed that he received 4 round feedback and it is positive , let me know the expectation. After receiving the expectations, he called within 30 minutes that remaining 2 rounds feedback are negative so we are not proceeding.Although all my interview round went pretty well.Scenario 2 : After applied to informatica, this recruiter called and started talking rudely that, “do you know anything about informatica or applied randomly” before giving other person chance to start replying. Anyways after completing telephonic and 6 onsite rounds, this recruiter called and informed that all rounds feedback is positive and they wanted to move ahead with offer and asked for expectation. After telling him the expectation, he immediately started trying to cancel the call , even after I was saying that I am ready to negotate, he said he will check again and never came back .After following up on mail he replied that we are interviewing other candidates, this is so unprofessional.The question is why they normally bring the people onsite and wasting their time by taking 6-7 round whole day, if their plan is just to take candidates based on lower TC and not on talent.If thats the case just take 2-3 rounds and select the candidate.The interviewers in both the time were good and talented but highly disappointed with the recruitment process of informatica.",9,7,2019-8-31 01:59:28,/post/Informatica---Beware-Tdk3QLCq,Informatica

0,Shady manager @ “Prestigious” hospital finally laid me off can I sue?,THSL52,/company/Informatica/,nan,"So here’s the whole story, left Informatica to join “prestigious” hospital. Prior to joining it was agreed that I would not be at a hospital location, during interview this was reiterated.Side note- I’m so stupid I didn’t read my offer letter, apparently “prestigious” hospital put everyone on a 6mos trial period, discovered this too late to turn back.First two week I was in the office like we had agreed, I was happy as a clam. After two weeks manager decided to send me to the hospital and I freaked out. I complained to him and he felt offended/disrespected or whatever. One week after our conversation he put me on PIP (performance improvement plan). Which is insane because even when I was having problem I did everything that was asked of me. Also, how can you give someone a warning then one week later PIP them if he truly care about my career? Is totally out of retaliation because he felt “disrespected” by my complaining and speaking up. Three weeks later after PIP he fired me... the entire time I was on PIP he never reached out to me to talk to me about performance or anything. And again I was doing everything that was asked of me as far as job performance. During the firing he just handed me my paycheck and tell me to leave.So my question is do I have a case for anything? I feel like I don’t because of the contract says that I’m on a 6mo trials so it allowed them to fire me for any reason and secondly CA is employment at will state... so I think I’m just screwed. I don’t care about the money or anything but all this just didn’t sit well with me, I just feel like I got fired because retaliatory manager 🤷‍♂️#2020 😅#Badmanager",0,14,2020-10-22 02:21:30,/post/Shady-manager-@-Prestigious”-hospital-finally-laid-me-off-can-I-sue-bBonPgaU,Informatica
