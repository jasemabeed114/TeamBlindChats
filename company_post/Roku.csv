0,Roku v/s ISPs,skhdue,/company/Netflix/,nan,"Thoughts on the ongoing battle between Roku and ISPs in US (Comcast and Att)1. Comcast is giving out flex (their version or roku stick) for free. Assuming att will come out with one soon if they haven‚Äôt already. Other ISPs around the world likely to follow.2. The hardware from these ISPs (like flex from comcast) will run a ‚Äúglorified‚Äù version of android tv.3. It seems to be a matter of time before these free boxes from the major ISP providers in US will replace roku and make the need for having roku obsolete. i.e. Anyone with an internet connection can get as many streaming boxes as they need for free which do the same thing as what roku does today.I personally think ISPs around the world will have no choice but to also provide a streaming box as part of their plans. The need of the hour is an open source platform and Android TV fits the bill. So how many years before Roku goes the dinosaur route? (poll)P.S.

Since it went down in 60s I decided to average cost and bought 15 more shares at cheaper price which brought down my average cost to 114 per share. This morning I had 100 total shares of Roku at $114 per share.Still I want to reduce my cost basic but can not buy more shares since it is already trading more than my existing cost basis.So I decided to SELL $150 call option expiring May 08 to receive premium of $6.50 which brought my cost basis to $108 per share. Now my question is what happens to my shares when ROKU price is below or above $150 by expiration date which is May 08Here is my understanding,1. If Roku stock is at any value BELOW 150 on May 08, I still owns the shares but at price $108 per share.2. If Roku price is at any value ABOVE 150 on May 08, then all 100 shares will be wiped from my account and my account will be credited with USD 15,000.

0,Roku Covered Call (Sell $150 Call expiring May 08),YAiC51,/company/DocuSign/,nan,"I have had bought ROKU 85 shares at $122 while back. Since she went down in 60s I decided to average cost and bought 15 more shares at cheaper price which brought down my average cost to 114 per share. This morning I had 100 total shares of Roku at $114 per share.Still I want to reduce my cost basic but can not buy more shares since she is already trading more than my existing cost basis.So I decided to SELL $150 call option expiring May 08 to receive premium of $6.50 which brought my cost basis to $108 per share. Now my question is what happens to my shares when ROKU price is below or above $150.Here is my understanding,1. If Roku stock is at any value BELOW 150, I still owns the shares but at price $108 per share.2. If Roku price is at any value ABOVE 150, then all 100 shares will be wiped from my account and my account will be credited with USD 15,000. [Max profit here would be (150-108)*100 = 4200]Is my understanding right?#roku #options #trading #tradingtech #coveredcall #stockmarket #stockoptions #stock #etrade",1,0,2020-4-20 19:38:06,/post/Roku-Covered-Call-Sell-150-Call-expiring-May-08-FRHpu2VU,Roku
