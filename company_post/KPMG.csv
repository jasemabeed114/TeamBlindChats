I went back to HR Thursday asking if they could have flexibility on the salary. HR raised it with the hiring team, but the rep told me he was surprised that I was asking for me because they gave me what I originally asked for.For those at KPMG, did you negotiate your salary and if so, how long did it take for them to come back after your counter offer?

0,Reaching out to a Recruiter through LinkedIn ,XJAK12,/company/KPMG/,nan,"I want to reach out to a recruiter that now recruits for a FANG company for tech positions. Is my message too long? if so, how can I shorten it?I haven't talked to her for quite some so I wanted to refresh her on our relationship. She’s a PM for tech staffing.Message:Hi [Name],I hope [Insert FANG] is treating you well in NY! I know it’s been quite some time but I wanted to thank you again for the opportunity of interning with [Previous Big 4 Accounting Firm]. I had an inkling that I wanted to do something along the side of IT but I didn’t have all that much experience but as time passed in college I knew I wanted to do something more with technology and programming because I became a database developer and was managing all of HR retail and residential dining services databases at my college. At that time I had already accepted an offer to move into IT Advisory at KPMG because I felt that this opportunity would be the best for me and it was! But I think now after working for a year I believe I should start focusing on more of my programming and data analytics passion. I wanted to reach out to you and ask if you could critique my resume and see if there are any positions at Google that I'd be great at working on that utilizes my skill set. I currently have 3 positions that I've applied for that I haven't heard back yet for and they're all data analyst positions.Thank you!",0,9,2019-9-26 19:22:29,/post/Reaching-out-to-a-Recruiter-through-LinkedIn-eAWv7DeY,KPMG
0,Controls will ruin the audit industry ,soccer4991,/company/KPMG/,nan,"Apologies in advance for my rant.In many ways, I think SOX has made auditors dumber in the last 15 years. The emphasis (at least at kpmg) is so focused on controls that I see many coworkers lacking the common sense and technical abilities to handle complex accounting problems and understand the most efficient way to test an account.It doesn't take intelligence to test and document a management review control. We know our regulators look for expectation, precision, and other key items in MRC control documentation. Once you have the SAPA 11 language down, it's basically a regurgitation exercise.The SAPA 11 principles are great in a vacuum, but that's not how the real world works. Does the PCAOB really think that before the VP of Accounting reviews a third-party valuation of intangibles, he/she thinks, ""gee, I'm going to set an expectation for what I think the WACC should be"".  The real world doesn't work like that and for anybody who puts that in their control documentation, I want what you're smoking!I'm sorry for the rant. :) As someone who went into auditing primarily for the technical accounting aspect, I find controls mind numbing and the single biggest hoax we peddle to the public.Feel free to hijack this thread with your own post-busy season rant. :)",16,7,2017-3-28 04:26:25,/post/Controls-will-ruin-the-audit-industry-ViYf6doW,KPMG
0,Just put in my two weeks.,Sinli,/company/KPMG/,nan,"It was a glorious moment for me. I've waited so long to make this transition. Both my manager and Sr. Manager were on PTO so whatever.I feel completely liberated and am beyond excited for my next role (Industry Sr. Revenue).There were times when I cried myself to sleep. There were times where I got scolded by clients and my Senior, who was years younger than me. There were days I just straight up lied that I had a family emergency because I thought I'd have a mental breakdown if I kept going at this pace.All in all, I've learned a lot and it's made be a much stronger person. I know I probably won't be doing 100+ hr weeks, but the confidence I have in myself knowing I could rock that for several weeks just pounding coffee makes me feel like I'll be successful wherever I go.Thank you KPMG for being the shittiest yet most memorable work experience of my career.Off to new ventures!I encourage all of you to do a round of interviews every 6 months to benchmark yourself against the market. It's much harder to do as an associate of a senior, but if you are creative with your time, it'll be a valuable experience that'll help shape your confidence. Don't become a modern day slave just doing as you are told, find out what you enjoy and always strive to gain exposure there.I'll end my rant here.",4,7,2016-8-4 21:05:15,/post/Just-put-in-my-two-weeks-37Yb2Fpm,KPMG
