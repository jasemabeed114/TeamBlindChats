0,Understanding Amazon PIP,phoenix88,/company/Amazon/,nan,Does a PIP really mean I suck at my job? My Forte reviews and feedback used to be quite good until I changed teams and suddenly everything started going downhill. Does it mean I really am not performing according to Amazon standards? It was my confidence to work in any team that brought me to this team in the first place. I see my peers progressing without any real trouble and I've just been trying to please my manager for the last year and a half but he's had issues with everything I have done and continues to do so.

TC is significantly a joke, where definitely they can give more on stocks at this level. 2. Amazon surprisingly extremely professional experience. Hiring manager is going above the way to want me and keeps checking in with me. The team is a very new team working in IoT related technologies so very low on-call load. Manager seems to like me a lot since day 1 as he had reached out to me himself and got me into the interview pipeline.What do you do here. Looking for sound advice. I fear PiP in Amazon but I had an open discussion with the manager on this and he said you are the last one that should be worried about this. Manager seems way too cool for Amazon standards.

Some people I heard were laid off just because the management chain doesn't like them.No one knew when the new firing system came.Atleast, I think Amazon managers give signals to employees that they would be let go soon so they can prepare accordingly via some programs which I read here like Focus, PIP etc.In Paytm, the situation was you were working (some on weekends) and the next day you got mail that you have been fired and all access revoked, just like that. All this during height of  pandemic. Senior people were rewarded with ESOPs to the tune of several crores.They later gave them 2 months severance, though, maybe after seeing other startups going over and above to reduce stress transferred to employees.Yeah, I know that it can't beat the Uber firings in a 4 minute Zoom call.Just wanted to know if Amazon fire culture is really that bad as portrayed here on Blind.All the details are in public domain news websites.

I absolutely DESPISED the org I was in but still did well enough to get promo'd, etc. A couple months after my promo, I decided to transfer cause leadership had their heads up their asses and it wasn't anything my direct manager or even their manager could solve despite many complaints. Despite being a top performer, I was just outright depressed and miserable. I found a team, that mentioned they needed someone with experience in my tech stack, had a technical interview, and bounced. Fast forward to end of three weeks of starting at this new place and the tech stack not even remotely close to my previous one and I've only opened 1 CR where I just renamed a function. I'm trying to read as many wiki docs as possible getting on calls with other engineers and managers who are telling me to take my time to ramp up and I am genuinely trying. I'm just getting lost and it's hard as hell with me not being in the office due to covid. I raised my concern about having zero familiarity with the tech stack on the second day with my manager and while I have been given only encouragement, I'm all too familiar with the pip horror stories in amazon. I'm pretty sure if I were in a tech stack that was actually similar to mine, pip would be the furthest thing on my mind. I'm just wondering if it's possible/worth transferring again to a new team because I am scared as hell to get pip'd and fired.

I was able to do it in Scala since I am more familiar with that than Python.Then the loop, where I met with 5 people:Person 1 - DE II - 2 LPs (insist on the highest standards / bias for action) - tech portion was about designing ETL workflows and data pipelines (""given scenario A, how would you design the pipeline for ingesting this data"").Person 2 - Sr BIE - 2 LPs (customer obsession / learn and be curious) - SQL questionsPerson 3 - DE II - 1 LP (invent and simplify) - tech questions about data modeling and normalization (I had to design tables for a meal delivery service)Person 4 - SDM (hiring manager) - 2 LPs (deliver results / earn trust) - Python question about converting a JSON input to a csv string. I don't use python in my day-to-day so even though my logic was sound I was iffy on some of the syntax I needed. They allowed me to pivot to Scala and asked me some questions about joining a couple dataframes together and performing an aggregation.Person 5 - Sr SDE (I think) - 3 LPs (forgot which ones) - I think this was the bar raiser, since no tech questions.Overall I thought I had done fairly well - I did stumble through a couple of the tech questions though, and even though I had fairly solid answers for most of the LPs, it's hard to tell what they really thought.Got a phone call two days later with the rejection.

I ended up being placed in a reasonably well growing AWS service team.My offer signed Aug 2019: 108k base salary, 24k first year bonus and 20k second year bonus, 70k in RSU.

I‚Äôm definitely not exceeding expectations but I think my manager is pretty content with my performance since they‚Äôve targeted me for promotion in the next 2 quarters. I was hoping for an RSU grant but I‚Äôve been reading about this total compensation model, and since the stock is up ~70% since joining, I‚Äôm now thinking I might not and I may just get the paltry 1.7% or so again. Does anyone have any thoughts/advice on what may happen?Something else I noticed, which maybe has always been true: seems like new incoming grads are making more than me, their offers: 116k base salary 27k first year bonus, 22k second year bonus, 86k rsu.

My google recruiter told me I may get ~33% stock refreshers grant after year 1. Is it true? How likely is it?! 5.

0,Amazon L6 chances of offer?,spmn147,nan,nan,"Hey all, I‚Äôm wondering what the chances of getting an offer are? In total I‚Äôve had seven interviews, two of them had two people in them at the same time.Interview one:This was my first interview and prepared about a week before with a spreadsheet of my STAR answers with the principals. The interview was with a financing person I'd work with. I felt like I answered the questions well for my first time but at the same time I felt like I could've done better as I typically criticize myself pretty hard. Got an email back from the recruiter that said I made it to round two!Interview two:After the first interview, I found gaps I could improve on. I updated my spreadsheet and continued to practice. Overall I felt like I did really well. I still found more things I could improve on so I added and altered more information on my spreadsheet. I also added as much to the results section with qualitative and quantitative information. Once again the recruiter said I made it and am going to the final loop round.LOOP:Interview three Hiring manager:I knew going into this interview that it was going to be high anxiety because I had to nail this one due to the fact that it would be my hiring manager. The interview felt easy going and wasnt too difficult but didnt feel like I got a WOW impression. Felt JUST ok after this interview. I submitted my written assessment prior to this meeting and only this HR asked me about my written and only one question at that.Interview four (this one had two people):IMO I felt like I did terrible because the questions were phrased in a way I wasn‚Äôt prepared for and the interviews kept asking me to reexplain because they didn‚Äôt understand (didnt have problems with previous people). This interview was with another person I'd collaborate with but there was another finance person asking questions so it made it really hard to answer quickly. It would be one question after another of breaking down my LP examples. After this interview I just felt like for sure I wasnt going to get the job.Interview five:This person was similar to the previous interviewer as this person would be someone id collaborate with. I believe I did really well with this person. This person was so pleasant to interview with and felt easy.Interview six bar raiser:This interview had two people, one from prime video operations and the other from talent management. I knew this was the bar raiser as they had nothing to do with my role. This interview was really pleasant too and the interviewer sounded very interested. The operations sat back in silence as that person could coach the speaking interviewer. they had 9 years and 3 years at amazon.Interview seven:This person was with someone I would work closely with and I felt like I did great! It was a late interview so I've had many interviews by then already. Did great here and engaged well. We even geeked out a bit at the end with similar passion for audio system setup. I left feeling I might have a chance!I finished the loop last Thursday. When do you think I‚Äôll hear back?
