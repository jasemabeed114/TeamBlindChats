0,Choosing Nutanix over Cohesity,stop-down,/company/FireEye/,nan,"I have had similar offers from both companies, and yesterday I went with Nutanix after much deliberation with my partner, family and mentor. Had to quickly decide coz Cohesity had given me a deadline to give my decision, so didn't have much time.  Main consideration I traded pre IPO upside and potential better learning against was concern of WLB, as given my current physical and mental health condition, I really can't afford to get into stressful startup culture with bad WLB. Also, I'm considering this switch for longer term (2+ years).But now I'm feeling bad and having 2nd thoughts. Cohesity HM seemed very empathetic and considerate(reached out to me proactively to clear my concerns etc). Nutanix HM seemed like a really cool guy.Have I made a mistake? I've known Nutanix to be a nice company till very recently, when I saw many negative reviews on blind. I declined Coheisty very politely, now please guide me if I must call the Cohesity HM/recruiter back :P A few words about your choice will really help me with data points I might have missed.Offered TC:- Level - MTS3Nutanix: 35.5 LPA, Cohesity: 35.2 LPA - 39.5 LPA (considering IPO upside)~3 YoE",0,21,2021-5-22 03:29:12,/post/Choosing-Nutanix-over-Cohesity-SE2nNA0T,Cohesity

0,What's the best way to increase communication and cohesion with engineers segregated into FE-only and BE-only roles?  ,autom8🤖,/company/Knockaway-Inc/,Eng,"Strong communication on engineering teams is crucial in order to efficiently build and ship quality, non-buggy code without friction. The need for strong communication grows even greater on eng teams where engineers are either FE-only or BE-only because, rather than a single full-stack engineer building the FE and BE of a feature, two separate engineers are individually building from each end of a bridge -- hoping that the bridge will connect once they meet in the middle.My last company hired only Full-Stack engineers and they were responsible for building features from the ground-up, FE and BE (yeah yeah, I know I just explained what everyone already knows). This made inter-squad communication more efficient as there were fewer parties partaking in conversation --EX. A single FS Eng. is code-complete on a new feature consisting of FE and BE changes. The authoring eng moves the feature user-story ticket into ""ready for testing"" and assigns it to me, the QA. While testing the branch changes in dev, I find a bug with the new feature. I then file a defect sub-task ticket with details on the bug and assign the sub-task ticket to the authoring Full-Stack dev, at which time the dev and I talk about the bug to make sure we're on the same page. The dev fixes the defect and moves the defect sub-task ticket to ""ready for testing"" and I test it again to make sure the defect has been resolved. Then, after confirming the feature branch is working as expected, I approve the PR and make sure that all sub-tasks are complete and all pre-merge checks are complete before shipping the PR. All of this communication was between only two eng's, the QA and the authoring dev. Easy, low risk.Now, for segregated FE/BE eng teams, a single feature involves multiple devs to complete and thus exposes more risk for miscommunication and misalignment of acceptance criteria. My new company has FE-only and BE-only engineers rather than Full-stack engineers and we have a high-friction feature development process due to failed/misaligned communication. And it sucks. Bad.How do you overcome this? We have Jira and confluence and slack and yadda yadda yadda but communication is still an issue. Oh, and the eng team is fully-remote.",0,4,2019-12-4 19:19:51,/post/Whats-the-best-way-to-increase-communication-and-cohesion-with-engineers-segregated-into-FE-only-and-BE-only-roles-f26qEo6Q,Cohesity

So overall TC hike was ~10% but it was made to look like >30% considering potential year end stock appreciation. This was my first ever switch. New offers now, provide a TC bump of >25% on my current TC here.2) Location preference. New offers from Nutanix and Cohesity are at a more preferred location to me, thus not requiring relocation.3) I do feel  the team chemistry is pretty cold and not so much fun here. This could be coz of virtual onboarding and setup.Question now is, would you suggest me to jump to Cohesity/Nutanix; or stay put for at least a year, considering TC bump and other factors mentioned? #tech #jump #dilemma",0,5,2021-5-20 06:17:35,/post/Leaving-start-up-in-2-3-months-byb6ppnX,Cohesity

0,Interview thought process bull sh***,sdblind,nan,nan,"First of all, I am a fan of using leetcode style questions on interviews in large companies with a lot of positions to fill. It's provides a cohesive standard for interviewing that scales well. I believe it should reduce the amount of worthless hires.However, my post is about the notion that these kind of questions provide you insight into the candidates problem solving. Who came up with that bullshit and why do people keep parroting it?Let's say I ask you a leetcode medium/hard you've never seen anything like it before. There is no way that in 45 minutes you'll get it correct. You'll be showing me how bad your thought process is at trying to come up with something that took many people many hours to optimize. Then I will fail you for providing at best n squared algorithm.Now let's say you have seen something like it before. And you spent hours and days optimizing your thought process to get that answer. So all i see is your ability to memorize and recall something. If you were to face a new problem on the job, your thought process would be nothing like that. Plus I will pass you, even though it may have taken you a year to memorize that one question.So please don't say that it provides insights into ones thought process. It's simply a test to weed out people that can't comprehend something enough to memorize and recall it. The thought process you show will be the one you copied from other people.",18,23,2018-9-21 02:42:57,/post/Interview-thought-process-bull-sh-XgjMpp6Q,Cohesity
0,How do I make the most of my experience?,qpPW48,/company/Microchip-Technology/,Eng,"New grad been at my job for 5 monthsLong story short I joined a small team who's go no formal education and very poor fundamentals of software engineering. My code base is older than me in a language that's almost on the top of stack overflows most hated list (don't wanna give too many specifics)Point is that most of the time I spend fixing problems on a code base that I could probably completely re write on my own in under a month of solid work and have it run much better.None of our tables are at all normalized(I asked why and they didn't seem to understand what I was trying to do), duplicated data everywhere across multiple tables, they don't use git and opted for the file share route, no automation, no new technologies (it was almost a miracle I got a new laptop), and most of the time I spend writing docs for myself because there's quite literally nothing documented, but the way the system operates (if that's what you'd call it) doesn't make any sense at all anyway. Zero tests (not that I think we could test the code), and just no cohesive plan of how to maintain any of it. Im quite literally my teams newest hire in the last decade.Most of the time that I've been here I've just been fixing problems and asking why we did the things we did in certain areas, and I just don't know how I can really learn or progress when the things I do implament they don't completely follow because of their lack of fundamentals (things like core concepts of data structures and really utilizing object oriented programming and principles)Any advice of what I should do to make the best of my time?

They did not respond to this request.Then they ended the call and immediately blocked my LAN/official email.Meanwhile, they also stopped my salary without any intimation or explanation.After that, every few weeks someone from the HR team reaches out to me either on phone or emails me on personal mail asking me to send them a resignation email.

0,Litmus test for future academic career,internhope,/company/Amazon/,nan,"TLDR; Let me know of a good litmus test to see if I'm wasting my time pursuing theoretical physics/neuroscience. I've added a few options below, but you're welcome to suggest other methods.I'm a new grad who'll be starting at Amazon next week.Over the past few years (and especially this pandemic), I've become increasingly jaded about the idea of spending the rest of my career in tech. Instead, I think theoretical neuroscience research is my true calling; I spent a lot of my childhood learning about the brain (even did a few research internships in neuro labs during high school) and I firmly believe that neuroscience holds the keys to true AGI (which I also think a lot about).As for why theory and not experiment, I noticed that almost everyone in neuroscience runs experiments without trying to organize the results into a cohesive ""theory of everything"". As a result, while we've been able to get a pretty good understanding of individual neurons, we have very little quantitative insight into how those individual neurons determine brain function at a systems level.Thus, I'm a big believer in using the theoretical physics approach - building beautiful models that can generate structured hypotheses for experimental neuroscientists to test. However, unlike in theoretical physics, I believe there are many contributions to be made in neuroscience that can influence our daily lives. For example, an experimentally verified, quantitative model of human memory could let brain-computer interfaces (e.g. Neuralink) keep us from developing dementia.That being said, I'm also a pragmatist. I fully realize that making serious contributions to theoretical fields requires outlier ability and intense dedication (e.g. Ed Witten, Andrew Wiles). Therefore, I'm looking for a 5-10 year litmus test I can perform while working full-time as an SWE that will let me know if it's worth yolo-ing the rest of my life into this pursuit.Here's what I've come up with:1) Success in competitive programming (Codeforces 2200+) and math (Putnam top 100)For pros, competitive programming is somewhat related to tech. For example, an orange-level competitive programmer can likely pass interviews at most tech companies. Also, according to https://events.barcelonagse.eu/live/files/2302-patrickgaule59635pdf, success in competitive math correlates well with productivity in math research. However, neither will involve graduate math or any physics.2) Success in olympiad physics (IPhO gold medal)For pros, the content I learn will cover a large part of an undergraduate physics degree. However, most people say that there's a much weaker correlation between IPhO success and research success (as opposed to in competitive math). Also, IPhO doesn't require much math (not even multivariable calculus, differential equations, or linear algebra).3) Deep understanding of math/physics (acing Harvard math + Princeton physics qualifiers)For pros, this things I learn will be directly applicable to theoretical physics. However, there is a very strong possibility of being a false positive. That is, even though almost all math and physics PhDs can pass qualifying exams in their respective subjects, most PhD graduates do not make any contributions to their field.What do you guys think?

I'm looking for referrals to any FAANGMULA+ companies. Anyone willing to save me by hiring me? #help #tech #sde #hiring #newgrad #f1visa #opt #bayarea #us #software #engineering #swe #engineering #software #referral #hiring #jobhuntPlease drop a comment so I can DM you my info.Thanks!LC 160+Following are my COVID interview experiences so far (March - present)#Amazon-Was asked word search-2 from LC in the telephonic round, solved it, but wrote the boundary exit conditions during the DFS repetitively. He pointed that out and was changing it, when time got over. Recruiter gave a feedback that I am ""strong on DS and algos but not on code-readability. Try in 6 months"".#Cohesity-Went well until the final round where the interviewer gave me some miscellaneous question he didn't understand fully. He gives me alphabets (he gave me a long explanation of how they weren't ""alphabets"" first, and then called them ""strings"" and then ""elements"" and finally decided that it was irrelevant and proceeded with the main problem. IDK why he spent 10 mins figuring out what they are, and when I started asking questions about it, told that it was irrelevant to the problem) and their positions (Ex- 'A' comes before 'B', 'B' comes before 'C' and so on). I should print them in the right order in the end (ABC in this case). At this point he seemed totally dis-interested and wasn't even listening to what I was saying/asking (Seems like his juice totally ran out explaining the ""type"" of the input). I asked him how will the input be and he said ""however you want it to be"". I told him ill take it as an adjacency list (ex - [[A,B],[B,C]] where 1st element indicates it comes before 2nd) and he said ""whatever that works in the end"". I gave the solution where I store the positions of each character in a map(an adjacency matrix logically) and do a dfs on each character to print the position. I asked him if it was a satisfactory solution. He told me if ""I'm satisfied, he's satisfied"". I coded (and he seemed like he was working when I was coding) and after I finished, he scrolled my code in like 2 secs and told me the code would work. He later asked me what if there are duplicate positions in the input. I said the map would take care of it, he agreed that it was an invalid testcase and he said he's done with the interview. The recruiter later told me this round got me the reject and that I should ""practice more leetcode"". Don't know what went wrong here.#Office depot-Recruiter called me and asked why I'm changing jobs so soon (<30 days). Told him I'm on OPT and had to join somewhere for my visa status, and that I want to work as a software developer, and not as a consultant. He asked me questions on my work and said he'll set up an interview in the upcoming week. After 15mins, I got a reject mail. I called him back and asked him what went wrong, he said he doesn't recognize me and cut the call. He's not responding ever since to emails, did not try calling him again.#Ebay -I got an interview call for e-bay SDE new grad 2021 and had 4 rounds virtual onsite, 2 per day. I completed the first two interviews on the first day(1 Object oriented design- chess) and the 2nd was LRU cache with TTL. I solved both of them, and both the interviewers were satisfied with my solutions. Right on the morning of the second day before the interview, I got an email saying my interview was cancelled, no explanations. I assumed they didn't like my first round performance and respected them for not wasting their, nor my time further. However, the person who referred me followed up with the recruiter and got to know that a candidate accepted the offer right on the morning of my interview and hence stopped hiring for that particular team. Now if a manager likes my resume, I'll be picked for an interview again, but hasn't happened since a month. I'm here back to my shitty job, noting minutes of meetings with a software engineering degree.#EY-My current company, though technically is a success, is quite the anti-climax. I was interviewed for a Java developer position. They asked me 2 easy coding, had to code in lambda functions. They also asked about new Java8 features, AWS, DB design, stored procedures and functions. The interviewer did not believe any word of my answers, even though they were right and kept saying he's going to test my technical skills by scheduling more rounds. It seemed like he didn't know what I was talking about, and hence the dis-belief. I told him I'm ready for any further rounds. They hired me in the end. After I joined, the same person who interviewed me turns out, is my manager (On the business side and no technical knowledge AT ALL). He told me I'll work as a business analyst and I will note minutes of meetings for every technical interview I attend. I, to be polite, and not to point any fingers, told him that the recruiter (indirectly YOU) told me I'll be a java developer, but he told me with a sly smile that recruiters aren't really aware of anything.#Bloomberg-Just got a reject from the initial telephonic round. First 15 mins for resume walkover. Next 25 mins for coding. He gave me a lottery system to design with add(email), remove(email) and winner() functions. I used a dynamic array (vector in c++) to store and remove, random function to predict the winner. Not sure what went wrong here either. I was thinking of a better data structure and he asked me why. I told him the approach was too simple, and am thinking of a more efficient structure, especially for remove, because I've to search and delete the element(email) which is O(N) and was seeing if I could do it in O(1). I ended up using the array itself after he suggested my approach is acceptable. Does anyone have a better solution/ insight why I might have got a reject for this? (I also looked up the range of rand() function and told him I don't remember the range FYI). Last 5 mins for my questions for him.#microsoft#slack#paypal#facebook#twitter#dropbox#amazon#atlassian#brex#google#instacart#square#twilio#faang#datadog#snowflake#rubrik#bloomberg#stripe#snap#lyft#uber#spotify#apple#robinhood#yelp#vmware",3,13,2021-4-21 20:51:42,/post/Anyone-hiring-for-a-new-grad-SDE-Referral-would-be-greatly-appreciated-Trg5Jbb0,Cohesity
