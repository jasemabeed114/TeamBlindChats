The recruiter mentioned something about not gathering specific feedback until after I commit. From there they will decide on level and comp and then give me the offer. The recruiter is also aware that I'm currently awaiting numbers from other offers and have upcoming interviews as well.Is this a common practice in Apple? I'm not sure how I should handle this. Has anybody been in a similar situation or have any tips on how to navigate this? I really like the team but I can't really commit until I know more details about the compensation package.

Is this heaven?I am in a new grad program and we have lots of opportunities to rotate, or to take classes and just learn. We have hackathons and events, sessions with leadership... These types of things don’t exist “in the real world” I don’t think; also my new grad cohort is huge and filled with friendly people. At my old job I was the only non-boomer.Also my manager is really cool. He lets me take my time with code and implementation, really values good design and going about the right way of doing things, even if it takes longer.I’ve had the opportunity to work on fun projects and build cool things and quality “developer” infrastructure, because my manager believes in elevating the level of work and culture we have. A refactor or design never would’ve passed at my old job, where the focus was on purely delivery and speed.I’m in disbelief as to how great my first year has been, surely I think any minute now things will turn bad? Great WLB, good projects, and a manager that listens and addresses things as soon as I mention them.Is this what the FAANG hype was all about? In any case, thank you Apple for this amazing job, and thank you to the greater software industry for setting up such a good culture in tech.
