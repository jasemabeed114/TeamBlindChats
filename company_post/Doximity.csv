0,Doximity low compensation?,uSEi03,/company/Sony-Electronics/,nan,Got an offer at doximity that seems to be low. 115 base plus stock which recruiter said is worth a lot. Do they generally pay below average? What's it like working at doximity? Is it worth the pay cut? Would be great if current and former employees can chime in here. Kind of hating it here at Sony.Current base 125,2,10,2021-4-27 19:53:08,/post/Doximity-low-compensation-Xc8GmGjq,Doximity

0,When is it worth the paycut to move to another company?,oopslol,/company/Autodesk/,nan,"Hey guys,I got referred to doximity for a PM position and the recruiter said the range is '110k-130k maybe 140k'.I currently make 155k at an early stage startup (&lt30 people).Assuming I get an offer from Doximity,  I could be potentially taking a 15k paycut. What would you guys use to assess the two opportunities?Some notes..Current job:- Leadership is micromanagy- Only real PM on the team (no mentorship/skillshare)- 10 days PTO (no annual rollover, it's shitty)- Some number of equity that doesn't really mean anything right now- Hours are weird. I work with India devs from 9-11pm some nights on top of 10am-3pm normally. - Health insurance is meh, I'm on my wife's plan because it's better- Will prob WFH after COVID ends-155k baseDoximity (from what I understand):- Better PM culture/work culture overall- 'Unlimited PTO' - which I heard is more like 3 weeks- 140k base, top end, it sounds like- some 5k bonus?- Equity- Sounds like back to the office after COVID? WFH a few days before per glassdoor- Free food- Annual offsite- Sabbatical - Parental leave (want to have a kid in the next few years)- 401k matching- normal 9-5Any thoughts/tips?",2,24,2020-10-30 23:03:40,/post/When-is-it-worth-the-paycut-to-move-to-another-company-H16wzsQU,Doximity
