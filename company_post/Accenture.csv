0,Accenture Industry X Layoffs Ongoing,0x6279626e,/company/Accenture/,nan,"Accenture has been losing revenue in specific areas and is publicly rebranding several practices due to the ongoing COVID pandemic and other issues.Several botched contracts early in the year did not help the situation, where management was at each others throats, ultimately self-destructing any goodwill from their teams. People actively engaged at certain clients were put under a microscope for performance, and when the management fell through and the budget was tight, that's when rumors started circulating.June saw a reduction at the top, with 10% gone from Industry X -- Accenture's newest iteration on the Industry 4.0 paradigm which is global manufacturing, robotics, digital twin, IIOT, PLM, MES, etc. Many cut in this first wave were upper management, directors, and sales managers.Many of these cuts were due to the industries affected by COVID losing revenue (manufacturing is down, supply chains are tight, airlines are not servicing near-to-capacity, make-to-order orders are low, automotive manufacturing is down, etc.).Another reduction of unspecified % happened in August, and yet another is planned if the rumors (which all came true so far) are to be believed. From what I know this impacted people who didn't have a skillset in the IIOT/DT area regardless of performance and chargeability, as this is how they want to rebrand the Industry X focus and cut out the other aspects of the organization or move them elsewhere.However the cuts have extended to several areas of the core Accenture business across the technology, management consulting, strategy consulting, and digital consulting branches.

Lack of appreciation, and felt like they are treated like kids.Fyi, program managers (ftes) imposed most of the rules.List goes on...I can’t imagine working for a company (FB) that does not equally treat people that works on the site. Even though they are technically contractual, since they work closely with FTEs, shouldn’t they be treated equally as ftes?

I'll not be as good as expected for my career level (Accenture doesn't go deep in tech, is just consulting and PPTs).In the next 3 years, I'd like to start managing teams and I believe that to be a good manager it is important to know well all aspects of business and implementation. I believe that I would learn this at amazon, but according to my searches, the career progression at AWS is not as fast as  Accenture and I'm afraid to be stuck at the same level for years.Any opinions on that?#aws #accenture #careeradvice",2,14,2020-11-1 15:14:20,/post/AWS-Solutions-Architect-vs-Accenture-Consultant-KOJMGpiy,Accenture

They have offered my a full time position with TC around 270K. I got an offer from AWS CFM group. L6 position TC 350K. Pro for staying at accenture is that I have a team reporting to me and existing relationships that have made for a wonderful WLB. Pro for AWS is obviously the name value of a company like AWS on resume and a much higher TC but from what I hear not great WLB plus I'llbe an individual contributor.Would appreciate blind community thoughts on this and help me make a decision on which to choose.

Her manager and HR suggested that they can give a hike of 40% if stayed back without any promises for promotion and this happened 3 weeks back. During the last couple of days, they were trying to blackmail her to stay back in the company by saying that they will put a remark that she cannot be hired back under code of conduct as they planned to give her a hike but she still decided to leave. She didn’t receive any letter for hike until now, every conversation happened verbally. Please bare in mind that she got married but living separately due to some personal issues with her husband and currently going through a touch phase in marriage and single earning as she is supporting her family. She is scared that if she joins Accenture and fired there, she won’t be able to get a job and might not be able to go back to Infosys if they put a remark that she can’t be hired back. Is this even legal in Infosys for that matter in any company. I have tried to talk to her to move to Accenture but she is unable to decide with everything going on.
