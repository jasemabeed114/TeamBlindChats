0,Qualcomm sync up call with HM,pTww02,/company/Nokia/,nan,"I interviewed with Qualcomm in September 2019. I was offered a base salary of 105k which I ultimately rejected. I was getting a base salary of 130k in Nokia at that time and it didn‚Äôt make sense to go to Qcomm with 25k less in my pocket. It has been almost 1.5 years now and I reached out to the manager again on LinkedIn . My idea was that after gaining some experience at Nokia, I could be hired as a Senior Engineer which might justify the switch. He wants to do a sync up call with me in a couple of days.My current base salary at Nokia is 140k and my performance review for this year is currently pending. My manager verbally told me that he will initiate my level increase formalities in this quarter and I expect around 7-10k raise if not more. I also received 60k worth of stocks in April from Nokia.I want a base salary of at-least 140k in order for me to consider the switch but knowing that I approached the manager on LinkedIn, will it piss him off if I quote 140k and ultimately decline the offer because of low salary after making the first move myself? Is that even realistic to ask for 140k in San Diego considering that I have 2 YOE ? My current location is Bay Area but as far as I know, the cost of living in San Diego is pretty much the same as Bay Area.

0,Horrible Experience with Qualcomm India,Hlok,/company/Oracle/,nan,Just wanted to share a horrible experience of my friend.Last year 2019 when the lockdown started QC didn't allow employees to move back to their hometowns not even bachelors. They asked a few employees to come to offices in mid of lockdown also for buisness needs.After unlocking also some employees requested them that they want to move back to hometown as it's not manageable but upper management refused.One horrible incident is one where a employee raiser concerns about health safety and in response to that HR handed over that to that employee. I mean like if that guy has a heart attack he will first write an email.When many employees started leaving then upper management realised and said they can make an exception to the employee to allow wfh from hometown.Not to everyone but the ones who gave there resignation. Not a single management person came to office during lockdown due to safety concerns.@Qualcomm,3,3,2021-5-10 19:39:11,/post/Horrible-Experience-with-Qualcomm-India-LMyMGkyU,Qualcomm

0,Should I accept Qualcomm SWE internship?,IpvH02,nan,nan,"I got an offer for an SWE internship at Qualcomm and I am deciding whether to take it. For context, I am an undergraduate CS student who will be graduating next year, so I am making this decision based off on which place I would like to work full time, in the case that I do not receive any better offers next year when I apply to full time positions. I actually already have an internship at another company, Company A, so if I accept Qualcomm‚Äôs offer I would have to renege my previous internship. Company A specializes in machine learning and data analytics for defense and government customers.Here are pros and cons of each company:QUALCOMMPros:- Likely to be higher full time salary. Based on info from this sub and levels.fyi, I can expect 100k+ in the new grad comp. There is not much info about salary for Company A since it is a smaller company, but based on Glassdoor it is probably 80-90K base, no stock since it is not publicly traded.- Bigger name, so it may attract more recruiters when it comes time to apply to full time offers.- The higher full time salary can work to my advantage when it comes to negotiating other full time offers I may receiveCons:- Not particularly interested in the wireless technology industry. A family member advised me to not go to Qualcomm because it is in a mature industry, there is no further innovation, and because there is a lot of foreign competition in the smartphone market. So chances are, if I do end up working here full time, I may want to transfer to another company within 1-2 years in a higher growing industry. Would like some experts in the field to shed more light on where Qualcomm is headed in the future.- Although not set in stone, full time location may be far away from home since a lot of their positions are in San Diego, their HQ. My family lives on the east coast, and I plan to visit them often, maybe once every 2-3 months.- If I accept this offer, I would have to renege my original internship.COMPANY APros:- Industry is in ML/AI/data analytics, which has huge potential for growth, and is also applicable to many industries like finance, healthcare, etc. My concern with Qualcomm is that I may be pigeon holed to hardware and working with low level software, whereas ML knowledge can be applied to more industriesCons:- Possibly lower full time salary- It is a no-name small company. I personally do not care about company name brand, but for internships, a big name like Qualcomm may attract more companies when applying to new grad roles.- I got an internship for a machine learning role. Since I do not have a background in ML and I do not plan on pursuing a masters/PhD in ML, if I start off as a ML engineer, I may not be able to advance in the role.I feel like neither of these positions really align with my true interests, which is in entrepreneurship and product management. I was not successful in landing PM internships this year. My ultimate career goal is to start a company, join a high growth startup, or become a PM at a tech company, so I would also like some insight on which position would better allow me to achieve those goals. #qualcomm #softwareengineer #newgrad #internship",0,6,2021-3-28 17:30:25,/post/Should-I-accept-Qualcomm-SWE-internship-eaSY1jTw,Qualcomm
