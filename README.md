# TeamBlindChats

# Motivation
This project crawls chats from a major anonymous online forum for tech employees. I use this corpus to understand (1) employee individual incentives, and (2) patterns of social interactions, and (3) career mobility in the US tech sector. This online community has advantages over other social media in two aspects (1) it verifies employees through work email, and (2) it has patented technology in keeping user identity untraceable. It has registered users from over 83,000 companies.
